fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Syntax.html#function-calls","fragment":"Function calls\nMeson provides a set of usable functions. The most common use case is\ncreating build objects.\nMost functions take only few positional arguments but several keyword\narguments, which are specified like this:\nStarting with version 0.49.0 keyword arguments can be specified\ndynamically. This is done by passing dictionary representing the\nkeywords to set in the kwargs keyword. The previous example would be\nspecified like this:\nA single function can take keyword arguments both directly in the\nfunction call and indirectly via the kwargs keyword argument. The\nonly limitation is that it is a hard error to pass any particular key\nboth as a direct and indirect argument.\nAttempting to do this causes Meson to immediately exit with an error.\n"});
