fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Using-with-Visual-Studio.html#page-description","fragment":"In order to generate Visual Studio projects, Meson needs to know the\nsettings of your installed version of Visual Studio. The only way to\nget this information is to run Meson under the Visual Studio Command\nPrompt.\nYou can always find the Visual Studio Command Prompt by searching from\nthe Start Menu. However, the name is different for each Visual Studio\nversion. With Visual Studio 2019, look for \"x64 Native Tools Command\nPrompt for VS 2019\". The next steps are the same as\nalways:\nIf you wish to generate Visual Studio project files, pass --backend vs. At the time of writing the Ninja backend is more mature than the\nVS backend so you might want to use it for serious work.\n(new in 0.52.0)\nYou will first need to get a copy of llvm+clang for Windows, such versions\nare available from a number of sources, including the llvm website. Then you\nwill need the llvm toolset extension for visual\nstudio.\nYou then need to either use a native file\nor set CC=clang-cl, and set CXX=clang-cl to use those compilers, Meson\nwill do the rest.\nThis only works with visual studio 2017 and 2019.\nThere is currently no support in Meson for clang/c2.\n(new in 0.52.0)\nTo use ICL you need only have ICL installed and launch an ICL development\nshell like you would for the ninja backend and Meson will take care of it.\n"});
