For example\nsuppose you have a standalone dependency library that builds with\nbuild system X. In this case having Meson call the build system to\nbuild the dependency at build time would be interpreted as mixing\nbuild systems. On the other hand a \"Flatpak-like\" approach of building\nand installing the library with an external mechanism and consuming it\nvia a standard build-system agnostic method such as Pkg-Config would\nnot be considered build system mixing. Use of uninstalled-pkgconfig\nfiles is considered mixing, though.\n"});
