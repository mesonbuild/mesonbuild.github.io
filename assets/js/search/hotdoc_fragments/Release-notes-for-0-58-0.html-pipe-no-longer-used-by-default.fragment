If you need this, then you can\nadd it manually. However note that you should not do this unless you\nhave actually measured that it provides performance improvements. In\nour tests we could not find a case where adding -pipe made\ncompilation faster and using -pipe can cause sporadic build\nfailures in certain\ncases.\n"});
