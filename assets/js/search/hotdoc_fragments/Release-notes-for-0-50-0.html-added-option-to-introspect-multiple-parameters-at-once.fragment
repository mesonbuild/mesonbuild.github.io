The results are then printed as a single\nJSON object.\nThe format for a single command was not changed to keep backward\ncompatibility.\nFurthermore the option -a,--all, -i,--indent and\n-f,--force-object-output were added to print all introspection\ninformation in one go, format the JSON output (the default is still\ncompact JSON) and force use the new output format, even if only one\nintrospection command was given.\nA complete introspection dump is also stored in the meson-info\ndirectory. This dump will be (re)generated each time meson updates the\nconfiguration of the build directory.\nAdditionally the format of meson introspect target was changed:\n\nNew: the sources key. It stores the source files of a target and their compiler parameters.\nNew: the defined_in key. It stores the Meson file where a target is defined\nNew: the subproject key. It stores the name of the subproject where a target is defined.\nAdded new target types (jar, shared module).\n\n"});
