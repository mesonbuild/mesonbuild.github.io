fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Yaml-RefMan.html#linking-to-the-reference-manual","fragment":"Linking to the Reference Manual\nLinks to the Reference Manual can be inserted anywhere in the Meson docs with\ntags like this: [[<tag>]]. This guarantees that links remain stable (even if\nthe structure of the Reference Manual changes) and are uniformly formatted\neverywhere.\nTo link to functions, the function name should be put into the tag:\n[[<func name>]].\nMethods (for all kinds of objects, including modules) can be linked to like\nthis: [[<object name>.<method name>]].\nTo link to objects themselves, the [[@<object name>]] syntax can be used.\nThese tags do not need to be put in inline code! A hotdoc extension handles\nthe formatting here. If tags need to be placed (for instance, to include reference\ndirectly in code blocks), the [[#<remaining tag>]] syntax should be used.\nExamples:\nNow the same in a code block:\n\nFunctions: executable()\n\nMethods: meson.version()\n\nObjects: str\n\n\n"});
