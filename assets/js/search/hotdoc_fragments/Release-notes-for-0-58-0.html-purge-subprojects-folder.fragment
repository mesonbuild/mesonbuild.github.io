This is useful\nwhen you want to return to a completely clean source tree or busting caches with\nstale patch directories or caches. By default the command will only print out\nwhat it is removing. You need to pass --confirm to the command for actual\nartifacts to be purged.\nBy default all wrap-based subprojects will be purged.\n\n\nmeson subprojects purge prints non-cache wrap artifacts which will be\npurged.\n\nmeson subprojects purge --confirm purges non-cache wrap artifacts.\n\nmeson subprojects purge --confirm --include-cache also removes the cache\nartifacts.\n\nmeson subprojects purge --confirm subproj1 subproj2 removes non-cache wrap\nartifacts associated with the listed subprojects.\n\n"});
