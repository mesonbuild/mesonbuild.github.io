This option is therefore deprecated and\nthe new option build_always_stale is introduced.\nbuild_always_stale only marks the target to be always considered\nout of date, but does not add it to the set of default targets. The\nold behaviour can be achieved by combining build_always_stale with\nbuild_by_default.\nThe documentation has been updated accordingly.\n"});
