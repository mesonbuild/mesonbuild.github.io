This currently supports\ncmake, pkg-config, and config-tool based variables.\nIt accepts the keywords 'cmake', 'pkgconfig', 'pkgconfig_define',\n'configtool', 'internal', 'system', and 'default_value'.\n'pkgconfig_define' works just like the 'define_variable' argument to\nget_pkgconfig_variable. When this method is invoked the keyword\ncorresponding to the underlying type of the dependency will be used to\nlook for a variable. If that variable cannot be found or if the caller\ndoes not provide an argument for the type of dependency, one of the\nfollowing will happen: If 'default_value' was provided that value will\nbe returned, if 'default_value' was not provided then an error will be\nraised.\n"});
