Therefore Meson provides\nthe tools to detect properties of the system during configure time. To\nget most of this information, you first need to extract the compiler\nobject from the main\nmeson variable.\nHere we extract the C compiler. We could also have given the argument\ncpp to get the C++ compiler, objc to get the objective C compiler\nand so on. The call is valid for all languages specified in the\nproject declaration. Trying to obtain some other compiler will lead\nto an unrecoverable error.\n"});
