This is particularly useful\nin cases like pyInstaller where the Python command is meson.exe runpython,\nand the full path should not be used but rather the command array.\nThe method returns a list of strings representing the complete command needed\nto execute the external program, which may differ from just the full path\nreturned by full_path() in cases where wrapper commands or interpreters are\ninvolved.\n"});
