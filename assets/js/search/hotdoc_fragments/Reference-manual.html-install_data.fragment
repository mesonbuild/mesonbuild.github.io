The following keyword arguments are supported:\ninstall_dir: the absolute or relative path to the installation\ndirectory. If this is a relative path, it is assumed to be relative\nto the prefix.\nIf omitted, the directory defaults to {datadir}/{projectname} (since 0.45.0).\ninstall_mode: specify the file mode in symbolic format and\noptionally the owner/uid and group/gid for the installed files. For\nexample:\ninstall_mode: 'rw-r--r--' for just the file mode\ninstall_mode: ['rw-r--r--', 'nobody', 'nogroup'] for the file mode and the user/group\ninstall_mode: ['rw-r-----', 0, 0] for the file mode and uid/gid\nTo leave any of these three as the default, specify false.\nSee Installing for more examples.\n\n\ninstall_dir: the absolute or relative path to the installation\ndirectory.
