For historic reasons,\nthey are referred to as \"diff files\", since the \"patch\" name is already used for\noverlay archives.\nThe diff files are described by the diff_files property (a comma-separated\nlist), and must be available locally in the subprojects/packagefiles\ndirectory.\nMeson will apply the diff files after extracting or cloning the project, and\nafter applying the overlay archive (patch_*). For this feature, the patch or\ngit command-line tool must be available.\nThe diff files will be applied with -p1, i.e. treating the first path\ncomponent as a prefix to be stripped. This is the default for diffs produced by\nGit.\n"});
