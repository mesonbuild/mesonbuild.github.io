fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Yaml-RefMan.html#directory-structure","fragment":"Directory structure\nThe directory structure under docs/yaml is important, since it determines how\nthe YAML files are interpreted:\nFinally, modules are defined inside the modules subdirectory. Here, each\nmodule has its own directory. The module itself must be in a file called\nmodule.yaml. All objects returned by the module are then located next to this\nfile.\nThe name of the YAML files themselves are ignored (with the exception of\nmodule.yaml) and carry no specific meaning. However, it is recommended to name\nthe YAML files after the name entry of the object.\nAll objects and functions whose name starts with a _ are marked as private and\nare not exported in the final documents. The primary purpose of these files\nis to make inheriting functions and arguments easier.\n\n\nbuiltins: Documentation for builtin objects, such as meson\n\n\nelementary: Strings, lists, integers, void, etc.\n\nobjects: All Objects returned by functions and methods but not modules\n\nfunctions: All root meson functions (executable(), project(), etc.)\n\n"});
