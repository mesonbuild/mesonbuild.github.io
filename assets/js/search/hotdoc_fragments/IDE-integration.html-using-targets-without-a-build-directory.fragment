However, there\nare some key differences:\nThere is no guarantee that the sources list in target_sources is\ncorrect. There might be differences, due to internal limitations. It\nis also not guaranteed that all targets will be listed in the output.\nIt might even be possible that targets are listed, which won't exist\nwhen Meson is run normally. This can happen if a target is defined\ninside an if statement. Use this feature with care.\n\nThe paths in filename now are relative to the future build directory\nThe install_filename key is completely missing\nThere is only one entry in target_sources:\n\nWith the language set to unknown\n\nEmpty lists for compiler and parameters and generated_sources\n\nThe sources list should contain all sources of the target\n\n\n\n\nWith the language set to unknown\n\nEmpty lists for compiler and parameters and generated_sources\n\nThe sources list should contain all sources of the target\n\n"});
