If you need to use a non-Rust\nlinker, or support Meson < 1.9.0, see below.\nUntil Meson 1.9.0, Meson did not support creating a single target with\nRust and non Rust sources mixed together. One had to compile a separate\nRust static_library or shared_library, and link it into the C build\ntarget (e.g., a library or an executable).\n"});
