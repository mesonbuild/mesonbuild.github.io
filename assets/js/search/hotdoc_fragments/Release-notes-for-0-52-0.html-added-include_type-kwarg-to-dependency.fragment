It can take the\nvalues 'preserve', 'system' and 'non-system'. If it is set to 'system',\nall include directories of the dependency are marked as system dependencies.\nThe default value of include_type is 'preserve'.\nAdditionally, it is also possible to check and change the\ninclude_type state of an existing dependency object with the new\ninclude_type() and as_system() methods.\n"});
