This support is\nexperimental and is currently limited to the iCE 40 series of FPGA\nchips.\nFPGA generation integrates with other parts of Meson seamlessly. As an\nexample, here is an example\nproject that compiles a simple firmware into Verilog and combines that\nwith an lm32 softcore processor.\n"});
