fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Commands.html#setup","fragment":"setup\nConfigures a build directory for the Meson project.\nDeprecated since 0.64.0: This is the default Meson command (invoked if there\nwas no COMMAND supplied). However, supplying the command is necessary to avoid\nclashes with future added commands, so \"setup\" should be used explicitly.\nSince 1.1.0 --reconfigure is allowed even if the build directory does not\nalready exist, that argument is ignored in that case.\nSince 1.3.0 If the build directory already exists, options are updated with\ntheir new value given on the command line (-Dopt=value). Unless --reconfigure\nis also specified, this won't reconfigure immediately. This has the same behaviour\nas meson configure <builddir> -Dopt=value.\nSince 1.3.0 It is possible to clear the cache and reconfigure in a single command\nwith meson setup --clearcache --reconfigure <builddir>.\nSee Meson introduction\npage for more info.\n"});
