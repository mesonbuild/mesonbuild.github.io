fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"CMake-module.html#cmake-subprojects","fragment":"CMake subprojects\nUsing CMake subprojects is similar to using the \"normal\" Meson\nsubprojects. They also have to be located in the subprojects\ndirectory.\nExample:\nThe subproject method is almost identical to the normal Meson\nsubproject function. The only difference is that a CMake project\ninstead of a Meson project is configured.\nThe returned sub_proj supports the same options as a \"normal\"\nsubproject. Meson automatically detects CMake build targets, which can\nbe accessed with the methods listed below.\nIt is usually enough to just use the dependency object returned by the\ndependency() method in the build targets. This is almost identical\nto using declare_dependency() object from a normal Meson subproject.\nIt is also possible to use executables defined in the CMake project as code\ngenerators with the target() method:\nIt should be noted that not all projects are guaranteed to work. The\nsafest approach would still be to create a meson.build for the\nsubprojects in question.\n"});
