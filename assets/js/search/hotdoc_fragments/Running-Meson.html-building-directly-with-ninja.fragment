fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Running-Meson.html#building-directly-with-ninja","fragment":"Building directly with ninja\nBy default Meson uses the Ninja build\nsystem to actually build the code. To start\nthe build, simply type the following command.\nThe main usability difference between Ninja and Make is that Ninja\nwill automatically detect the number of CPUs in your computer and\nparallelize itself accordingly. You can override the amount of\nparallel processes used with the command line argument -j <num processes>.\nIt should be noted that after the initial configure step ninja is\nthe only command you ever need to type to compile. No matter how you\nalter your source tree (short of moving it to a completely new\nlocation), Meson will detect the changes and regenerate itself\naccordingly. This is especially handy if you have multiple build\ndirectories. Often one of them is used for development (the \"debug\"\nbuild) and others only every now and then (such as a \"static analysis\"\nbuild). Any configuration can be built just by cd'ing to the\ncorresponding directory and running Ninja.\n"});
