fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Running-Meson.html#environment-variables","fragment":"Environment variables\nSometimes you want to add extra compiler flags, this can be done by\npassing them in environment variables when calling Meson. See the\nreference\ntables\nfor a list of all the environment variables. Be aware however these\nenvironment variables are only used for the native compiler and will\nnot affect the compiler used for cross-compiling, where the flags\nspecified in the cross file will be used.\nFurthermore it is possible to stop Meson from adding flags itself by\nusing the --buildtype=plain option, in this case you must provide\nthe full compiler and linker arguments needed.\n"});
