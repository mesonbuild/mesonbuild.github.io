Python >= 3.11 have one built-in, older\nPython versions require either the external tomli module or toml2json program.\nFor example, a Cargo project with the package name foo-bar would have a wrap\nfile like that:\nIn addition, if the file meson/meson.build exists, Meson will call subdir('meson')\nwhere the project can add manual logic that would usually be part of build.rs.\nSome naming conventions need to be respected:\nSince 1.5.0 Cargo wraps can also be provided with Cargo.lock file at the root\nof (sub)project source tree. Meson will automatically load that file and convert\nit into a series of wraps definitions.\n\n\npackage_name is defined in [package] name = ... section of the Cargo.toml.\n\nversion is the API version deduced from [package] version = ... as follow:\n\n\nx.y.z -> 'x'\n\n0.x.y -> '0.x'\n\n0.0.x -> '0'\nIt allows to make different dependencies for incompatible versions of the same\ncrate.\n\n\nthe suffix is -rs for rlib and dylib crate types, otherwise it is the\ncrate type (e.g. staticlib or cdylib).  The suffix is added to distinguish\nRust crates from regular system dependencies; for example gstreamer-1.0 is a\nsystem pkg-config dependency and gstreamer-0.22-rs is a Cargo dependency.\n\n\n\nx.y.z -> 'x'\n\n0.x.y -> '0.x'\n\n0.0.x -> '0'\nIt allows to make different dependencies for incompatible versions of the same\ncrate.\n\n\nThe extra_args variable is pre-defined and can be used to add any Rust arguments.\nThis is typically used as extra_args += ['--cfg', 'foo'].\nThe extra_deps variable is pre-defined and can be used to add extra dependencies.\nThis is typically used as extra_deps += dependency('foo').\n\n"});
