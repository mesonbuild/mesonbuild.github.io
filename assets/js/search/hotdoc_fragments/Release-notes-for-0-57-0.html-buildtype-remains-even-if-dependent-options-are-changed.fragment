Traditionally setting the\noptions to other values would then change the buildtype to custom.\nThis is confusing and means that you can't use, for example, debug\nlevel g in debug buildtype even though it would make sense under\nmany circumstances.\nStarting with this release, the buildtype is only changed when the user\nexplicitly sets it; setting the build type modifies the debug and\noptimization options as before.\n"});
