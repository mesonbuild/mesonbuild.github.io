It gives you all things\nyou would expect, such as installing and updating dependencies. The\nwrap tool works on all platforms, the only limitation is that the wrap\ndefinition works on your target platform. If you find some Wraps that\ndon't work, please file bugs or, even better, patches.\nAll code examples here assume that you are running the commands in\nyour top level source directory. Lines that start with the $ mark\nare commands to type.\nThe simplest operation to do is to query the list of packages\navailable. To list them all issue the following command:\nUsually you want to search for a specific package. This can be done\nwith the search command:\nTo determine which versions of libjpeg are available to install, issue\nthe info command:\nThe first number is the upstream release version, in this case\n9a. The second number is the Wrap revision number. They don't relate\nto anything in particular, but larger numbers imply newer\nreleases. You should always use the newest available release.\nInstalling dependencies is just as straightforward. First just create\nthe subprojects directory at the top of your source tree and issue\nthe install command.\nNow you can issue a subproject('libjpeg') in your meson.build file\nto use it.\nTo check if your projects are up to date you can issue the status command.\nIn this case zlib has a newer release available. Updating it is\nstraightforward:\nWraptool can do other things besides these. Documentation for these\ncan be found in the command line help, which can be accessed by\nmeson wrap --help.\n"});
