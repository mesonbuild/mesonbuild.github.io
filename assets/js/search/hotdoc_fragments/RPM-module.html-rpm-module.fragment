It autodetects installed files, dependencies and so\non. Using it is very simple. At the very end of your Meson project\n(that is, the end of your top level meson.build file) add these two\nlines.\nRun Meson once on your code and the template will be written in your\nbuild directory. Then remove the two lines above and manually edit the\ntemplate to add missing information. After this it is ready for use.\n"});
