fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Release-notes-for-0-51-0.html#new-target-keyword-argument-link_language","fragment":"New target keyword argument: link_language\n\nThere may be situations for which the user wishes to manually specify\nthe linking language.  For example, a C++ target may link C, Fortran,\netc. and perhaps the automatic detection in Meson does not pick the\ndesired compiler.  The user can manually choose the linker by language\nper-target like this example of a target where one wishes to link with\nthe Fortran compiler:\nA specific case this option fixes is where for example the main\nprogram is Fortran that calls C and/or C++ code. The automatic\nlanguage detection of Meson prioritizes C/C++, and so an compile-time\nerror results like undefined reference to main, because the linker\nis C or C++ instead of Fortran, which is fixed by this per-target\noverride.\n"});
