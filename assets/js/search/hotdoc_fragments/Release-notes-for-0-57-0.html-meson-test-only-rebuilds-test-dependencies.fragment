With this release, meson test\nwill only rebuild what is needed for the tests or suites that will be run.\nThis feature can be used, for example, to speed up bisecting regressions\nusing commands like the following:\nThis would find the broken commit automatically while at each step\nrebuilding only those pieces of code needed to run the test.\nHowever, this change could cause failures when upgrading to 0.57, if the\ndependencies are not specified correctly in meson.build.\n"});
