This enables the edit-and-continue debugging in\nVisual Studio IDE's.\nUnfortunately, it is also extremely expensive and breaks certain use cases such\nas link time code generation. Edit and continue can be enabled by manually by\nadding /ZI to compiler arguments.\nThe /ZI argument has now been replaced by the /Zi argument for debug builds.\nIf this is an important issue for you and would like a builtin toggle option,\nplease file an issue in the Meson bug tracker.\n"});
