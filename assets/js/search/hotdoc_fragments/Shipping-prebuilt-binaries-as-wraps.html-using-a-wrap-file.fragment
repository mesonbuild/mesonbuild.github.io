For this example our dependency is called\nbob.\nThe wrap ini (subprojects/bob.wrap):\nThen create subprojects/packagefiles/libbob/, and place the meson.build from\nabove in that directory. With these in place a call to dependency('bob') will\nfirst try standard discovery methods for your system (such as pkg-config, cmake,\nand any built-in meson find methods), and then fall back to using the binary\nwrap if it cannot find the dependency on the system. Meson provides the\n--force-fallback-for=bob command line option to force the use of the fallback.\n"});
