Some build systems call these \"object libraries\". Meson's\nimplementation does always create a static archive.\nThis will now check to see if the static linker supports \"thin archives\"\n(archives which do not contain the actual object code, only references to their\nlocation on disk) and if so, use them to minimize space usage and speed up\nlinking.\n"});
