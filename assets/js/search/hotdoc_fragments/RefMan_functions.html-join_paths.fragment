fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"RefMan_functions.html#join_paths","fragment":"join_paths()\nJoins the given strings into a file system path segment. For example\njoin_paths('foo', 'bar') results in foo/bar. If any one of the\nindividual segments is an absolute path, all segments before it are\ndropped. That means that join_paths('foo', '/bar') returns /bar.\n(since 0.49.0) Using the / operator on strings is equivalent to calling\njoin_paths().\n\nDon't use join_paths() for sources in library() and executable(). You should use files() instead.\n\n"});
