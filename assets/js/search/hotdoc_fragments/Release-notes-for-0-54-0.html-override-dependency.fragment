The overriding is global and\napplies to every subproject from there on.\nFor example, this subproject provides 2 libraries with version 2.0:\nAssuming the system has foo and bar 1.0 installed, and master project does this:\nThis used to mix system 1.0 version and subproject 2.0 dependencies,\nbut thanks to the override bar_dep is now set to the subproject's\nversion instead.\nAnother case this can be useful is to force a subproject to use a\nspecific dependency. If the subproject does dependency('foo') but\nthe main project wants to provide its own implementation of foo, it\ncan for example call meson.override_dependency('foo', declare_dependency(...)) before configuring the subproject.\n"});
