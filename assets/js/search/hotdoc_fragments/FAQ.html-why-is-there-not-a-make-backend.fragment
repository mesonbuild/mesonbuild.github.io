This is not an implementation issue, Make simply\ncannot be made fast. For further info we recommend you read this\npost\nby Evan Martin, the author of Ninja. Makefiles also have a syntax that\nis very unpleasant to write which makes them a big maintenance burden.\nThe only reason why one would use Make instead of Ninja is working on\na platform that does not have a Ninja port. Even in this case it is an\norder of magnitude less work to port Ninja than it is to write a Make\nbackend for Meson.\nJust use Ninja, you'll be happier that way. I guarantee it.\n"});
