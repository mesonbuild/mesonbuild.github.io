fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"RefMan_functions.html#library","fragment":"library()\nBuilds a library that is either static, shared or both depending on\nthe value of default_library\nuser option.\nYou should use this instead of shared_library(),\nstatic_library() or\nboth_libraries() most of the time. This allows you\nto toggle your entire project (including subprojects) from shared to\nstatic with only one option. This option applies to libraries being\nbuilt internal to the entire project. For external dependencies, the\ndefault library type preferred is shared. This can be adapted on a per\nlibrary basis using the dependency() static keyword.\nThe keyword arguments for this are the same as for\nbuild_target()\n\n\n"});
