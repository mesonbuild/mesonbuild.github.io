This is\nvery confusing and almost never what you want. To fix this a new\nkeyword native has been added to all functions that add arguments,\nnamely add_global_arguments, add_global_link_arguments,\nadd_project_arguments and add_project_link_arguments that behaves\nlike the following:\nAlso remember that cross compilation is a property of each target.\nThere can be target that are compiled with the native compiler and\nsome which are compiled with the cross compiler.\nUnfortunately this change is backwards incompatible and may cause some\nprojects to fail building. However this should be very rare in\npractice.\n"});
