This is the desired approach most of the time. However some projects benefit from having some minor optimizations enabled. GCC even has a specific compiler flag Og for this. To enable its use just issue the following command. \nThis causes all subsequent builds to use this command line argument. \nUsing profile guided optimization with GCC is a two phase operation. First we set up the project with profile measurements enabled and compile it. \nThen we need to run the program with some representative input. This step depends on your project. \nOnce that is done we change the compiler flags to use the generated information and rebuild. \nAfter these steps the resulting binary is fully optimized. \n"});
