In\nthis release we add support for compiling LLVM IR files in a similar\nway when building with the Clang compiler. Just add it to the list of\nfiles when creating a library or executable target like any other\nsource file. No special handling is required:\nAs always, you can also mix LLVM IR files with C++, C, and Assembly\n(GAS) sources.\n"});
