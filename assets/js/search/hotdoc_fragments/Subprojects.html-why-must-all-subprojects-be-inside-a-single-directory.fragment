Having the\nsubprojects in well defined places makes this easy. If subprojects could be\nanywhere at all, it would be a lot harder.\nSecond of all it is extremely important that end users can easily see what\nsubprojects any project has. Because they are in one, and only one, place,\nreviewing them becomes easy.\nThis is also a question of convention. Since all Meson projects have the same\nlayout w.r.t subprojects, switching between projects becomes easier. You don't\nhave to spend time on a new project traipsing through the source tree looking\nfor subprojects. They are always in the same place.\nFinally if you can have subprojects anywhere, this increases the possibility of\nhaving many different (possibly incompatible) versions of a dependency in your\nsource tree. Then changing some code (such as changing the order you traverse\ndirectories) may cause a completely different version of the subproject to be\nused by accident.\n"});
