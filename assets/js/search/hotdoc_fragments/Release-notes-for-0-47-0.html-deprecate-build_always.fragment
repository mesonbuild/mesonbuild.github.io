This option is therefore deprecated and the new option build_always_stale is introduced. \nbuild_always_stale only marks the target to be always considered out of date but does not add it to the set of default targets. The old behaviour can be achieved by combining build_always_stale with build_by_default. \nThe documentation has been updated accordingly. \n"});
