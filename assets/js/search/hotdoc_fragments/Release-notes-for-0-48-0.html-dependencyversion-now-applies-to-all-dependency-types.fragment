These constraints now\napply to dependencies found using any dependency provider.\nSome combinations of dependency, host and method do not currently\nsupport discovery of the version. In these cases, the dependency will\nnot be found if a version constraint is applied, otherwise the\nversion() method for the dependency object will return 'unknown'.\n(If discovering the version in one of these combinations is important\nto you, and a method exists to determine the version in that case,\nplease file an issue with as much information as possible.)\n"});
