fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "target_machine object \nProvides information about the target machine the machine on which the compiled binary s output will run. Hence this object should only be used while cross compiling a compiler. See Cross compilation. \nIt has the same methods as build_machine. \nWhen all compilation is native all the methods return the same values as build_machine because the build machine is the host machine and the target machine \nNote that while cross compiling it simply returns the values defined in the cross info file. If target_machine values are not defined in the cross info file host_machine values are returned instead. \n", "url": "Reference-manual.html#target_machine-object"});
