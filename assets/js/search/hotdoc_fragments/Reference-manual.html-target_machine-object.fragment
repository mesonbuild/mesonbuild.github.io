fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual.html#target_machine-object","fragment":"\ntarget_machine object\nProvides information about the target machine â€” the machine on which\nthe compiled binary's output will run. Hence, this object should only\nbe used while cross-compiling a compiler. See\nCross-compilation.\nIt has the same methods as build_machine.\nWhen all compilation is 'native', all the methods return the same\nvalues as build_machine (because the build machine is the host\nmachine and the target machine).\nNote that while cross-compiling, it simply returns the values defined\nin the cross-info file. If target_machine values are not defined in\nthe cross-info file, host_machine values are returned instead.\n"});
