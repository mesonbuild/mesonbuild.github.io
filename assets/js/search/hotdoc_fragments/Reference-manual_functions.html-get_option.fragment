fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#get_option","fragment":"get_option()\nObtains the value of the project build option\nspecified in the positional argument.\nNote that the value returned for built-in options that end in dir\nsuch as bindir and libdir is usually a path relative to (and\ninside) the prefix but you should not rely on that, as it can also\nbe an absolute path in some cases.\ninstall_dir arguments handle that as expected\nbut if you need an absolute path, e.g. to use in a define etc.,\nyou should use the path concatenation operator like this:\nget_option('prefix') / get_option('localstatedir').\nNever manually join paths as if they were strings.\nFor options of type feature a\nfeature option object\nis returned instead of a string.\nSee feature options\ndocumentation for more details.\nFor options that are specified\nper-machine\nget_option() retrieves the value of the option for the\nbuild machine if the argument starts with build..\n\n\n"});
