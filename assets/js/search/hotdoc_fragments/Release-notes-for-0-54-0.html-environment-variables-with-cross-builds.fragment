Now CC_FOR_BUILD is used for the build platform in\ncross builds.\nThis old behavior is inconsistent with the way Autotools works, which\nundermines the purpose of distro-integration that is the only reason\nenvironment variables are supported at all in Meson. The new behavior\nis not quite the same, but doesn't conflict: Meson doesn't always\nrepond to an environment when Autoconf would, but when it does it\ninterprets it as Autotools would.\n"});
