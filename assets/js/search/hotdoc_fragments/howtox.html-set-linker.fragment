fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"howtox.html#set-linker","fragment":"Set linker\nNew in 0.53.0\nLike the compiler, the linker is selected via the <compiler variable>_LD environment variable, or through the <compiler entry>_ld entry in a native or cross file. You must be aware of\nwhether you're using a compiler that invokes the linker itself (most\ncompilers including GCC and Clang) or a linker that is invoked\ndirectly (when using MSVC or compilers that act like it, including\nClang-Cl). With the former c_ld or CC_LD should be the value to\npass to the compiler's special argument (such as -fuse-ld with clang\nand gcc), with the latter it should be an executable, such as\nlld-link.exe.\nNOTE In Meson 0.53.0 the ld entry in the cross/native file and the\nLD environment variable were used, this resulted in a large number\nof regressions and was changed in 0.53.1 to <lang>_ld and <comp variable>_LD.\nor\nor in a cross or native file:\nThere is a table of all environment variables supported\nHere\n"});
