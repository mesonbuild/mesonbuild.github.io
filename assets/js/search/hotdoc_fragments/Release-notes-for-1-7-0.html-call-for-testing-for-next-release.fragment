This is a\nhuge change that will touch pretty much all code.\nThe main change it brings is that you can override any builtin option\nvalue for any subproject (even the top one) entirely from the command\nline. This means that you can, for example, enable optimizations on\nall subprojects but not on the top level project.\nWe have done extensive testing and all our tests currently\npass. However it is expected that this will break some workflows. So\nplease test the branch when it lands and report issues. We want to fix\nall regressions as soon as possible, preferably far before the next rc\nrelease.\n"});
