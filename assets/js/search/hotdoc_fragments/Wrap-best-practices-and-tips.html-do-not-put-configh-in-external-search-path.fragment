These files are never installed\nto the system header files so there are no inclusion collisions. This\nis not the case with subprojects, your project tree may have an\narbitrary number of configuration files, so we need to ensure they\ndon't clash.\nThe basic problem is that the users of the subproject must be able to\ninclude subproject headers without seeing its config.h file. The\nmost correct solution is to rename the config.h file into something\nunique, such as foobar-config.h. This is usually not feasible unless\nyou are the maintainer of the subproject in question.\nThe pragmatic solution is to put the config header in a directory that\nhas no other header files and then hide that from everyone else. One\nway is to create a top level subdirectory called internal and use\nthat to build your own sources, like this:\nMany projects keep their config.h in the top level directory that\nhas no other source files in it. In that case you don't need to move\nit but can just do this instead:\n"});
