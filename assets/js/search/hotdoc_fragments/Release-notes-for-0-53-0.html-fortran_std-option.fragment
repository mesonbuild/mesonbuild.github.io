Only the Gfortran and Intel Fortran\ncompilers have support for this option. Other Fortran compilers ignore\nthe fortran_std option.\nSupported values for fortran_std include:\n\n\nlegacy for non-conforming code--this is especially important for Gfortran, which by default errors on old non-compliant Fortran code\n\nf95 for Fortran 95 compliant code.\n\nf2003 for Fortran 2003 compliant code.\n\nf2008 for Fortran 2008 compliant code.\n\nf2018 for Fortran 2018 compliant code.\n\n"});
