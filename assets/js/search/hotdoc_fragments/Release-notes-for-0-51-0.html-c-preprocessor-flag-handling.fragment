(That latter would come from CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, etc.,\nalong with <lang>_args options whether specified no the command-line\ninterface (-D..), meson.build (default_options), or cross file\n([properties]).) This was mostly unobservable, except for certain\npreprocessor-only checks like check_header would only use the\npreprocessor flags, leading to confusion if some -isystem was in\nCFLAGS but not CPPFLAGS. Now, they are lumped together, and\nCPPFLAGS, for the languages which are deemed to care to about, is\njust another source of compilation flags along with the others already\nlisted.\n"});
