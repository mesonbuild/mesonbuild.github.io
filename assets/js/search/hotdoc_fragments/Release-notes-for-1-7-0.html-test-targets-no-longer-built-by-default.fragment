The behavior is now the same as when tests do have\nbuild dependencies, i.e. to only build the actual set of targets that are used\nby the test. This change could cause failures when upgrading to Meson 1.7.0, if\nthe dependencies are not specified correctly in meson.build. Using ninja test\nhas always been guaranteed to \"do the right thing\" and rebuild all as well;\nthis continues to work.\nninja all does not rebuild all tests anymore; it should be noted that this\nchange means test programs are no longer guaranteed to have been built,\ndepending on whether those test programs were also defined to build by\ndefault / marked as installable. This avoids building test-only binaries as\npart of installing the project (ninja && ninja install), which is unnecessary\nand has no use case.\nSome users might have been relying on the \"all\" target building test\ndependencies in combination with meson test --no-rebuild in order to skip\ncalling out to ninja when running tests. This might break with this change\nbecause, when given --no-rebuild, Meson provides no guarantee that test\ndependencies are present and up to date. The recommended workflow is to use\neither ninja test or ninja && meson test but, if you wish to build test\nprograms and dependencies in a separate stage, you can use for example ninja all meson-test-prereq meson-benchmark-prereq before meson test --no-rebuild.\nThese prereq targets have been available since meson 0.63.0.\n"});
