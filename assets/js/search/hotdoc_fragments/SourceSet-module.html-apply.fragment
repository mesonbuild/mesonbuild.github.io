A source\nconfiguration object allows you to retrieve the sources and\ndependencies for a specific configuration.\nBy default, all the variables that were specified in the rules have to\nbe present in conf_data. However, in some cases the convention is\nthat false configuration symbols are absent in conf_data; this is\nthe case for example when the configuration was loaded from a Kconfig\nfile. In that case you can specify the strict: false keyword\nargument, which will treat absent variables as false.\nReturns: a source configuration\n"});
