Instead, the dep_name = <target_name>_dep syntax should be used, where\n<target_name> is the name of a CMake library with all non alphanumeric\ncharacters replaced by underscores _.\nFor example, a CMake project that contains add_library(foo-bar ...) in its\nCMakeList.txt and that applications would usually find using the dependency\nname foo-bar-1.0 (e.g. via pkg-config) would have a wrap file like this:\n"});
