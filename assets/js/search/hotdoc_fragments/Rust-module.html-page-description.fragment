fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Rust-module.html#page-description","fragment":"(new in 0.57.0)\nNote Unstable modules make no backwards compatible API guarantees.\nThe rust module provides helper to integrate rust code into meson. The goal\nis to make using rust in meson more pleasant, while still remaining mesonic,\nthis means that it attempts to make rust work more like meson, rather than\nmeson work more like rust.\nThis function creates a new rust unittest target from an existing rust based\ntarget, which may be a library or executable. It does this by copying the\nsources and arguments passed to the original target and adding the --test\nargument to the compilation, then creates a new test target which calls that\nexecutable, using the rust test protocol.\nThis accepts all of the keyword arguments as the\ntest function except protocol, it will set\nthat automatically.\nAdditional, test only dependencies may be passed via the dependencies\nargument.\n"});
