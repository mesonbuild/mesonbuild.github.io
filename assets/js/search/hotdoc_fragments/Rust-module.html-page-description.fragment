fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Rust-module.html#page-description","fragment":"(new in 0.57.0)\nNote Unstable modules make no backwards compatible API guarantees.\nThe rust module provides helper to integrate rust code into Meson. The\ngoal is to make using rust in Meson more pleasant, while still\nremaining mesonic, this means that it attempts to make Rust work more\nlike Meson, rather than Meson work more like rust.\nThis function creates a new rust unittest target from an existing rust\nbased target, which may be a library or executable. It does this by\ncopying the sources and arguments passed to the original target and\nadding the --test argument to the compilation, then creates a new\ntest target which calls that executable, using the rust test protocol.\nThis accepts all of the keyword arguments as the\ntest function except protocol, it will set\nthat automatically.\nAdditional, test only dependencies may be passed via the dependencies\nargument.\n"});
