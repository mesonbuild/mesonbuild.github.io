fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Configuring-a-build-directory.html#per-project-subproject-options-rewrite-since-18","fragment":"Per project subproject options rewrite (Since 1.8)\nA common requirement when building large projects with many\nsubprojects is to build some (or all) subprojects with project options\nthat are different from the \"main project\". This has been sort of\npossible in a limited way but is now natively supported. Per project\noptions can be added, changed and removed at runtime using the command\nline, in other words, without editing existing meson.build files.\nStarting with version 1.8 you can specify per-project option settings.\nThese can be specified for every top level (i.e. not project) options.\nSuppose you have a project that has a single subproject called\nnumbercruncher that does heavy computation. During development you\nwant to build that subproject with optimizations enabled but your main\nproject without optimizations. This can be done by specifying a custom\nvalue to the given subproject:\nAnother case might be that you want to build with warnings as errors,\nbut some subproject does not support it. To configure werror per\nsubproject you can do:\nYou can also specify a different value on the top level project. For\nexample you could enable optimizations on all subprojects but not the\ntop level project:\nNote the colon after the second D.\nSubproject specific values can be removed with -U\n"});
