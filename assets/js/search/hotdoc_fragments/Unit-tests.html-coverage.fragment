fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Unit-tests.html#coverage","fragment":"Coverage\nIf you enable coverage measurements by giving Meson the command line\nflag -Db_coverage=true, you can generate coverage reports after\nrunning the tests (running the tests is required to gather the list of\nfunctions that get called). Meson will autodetect what coverage\ngenerator tools you have installed and will generate the corresponding\ntargets. These targets are coverage-xml and coverage-text which\nare both provided by Gcovr (version 3.3 or higher)\nand coverage-html, which requires\nLcov and\nGenHTML or\nGcovr. As a convenience, a high-level coverage\ntarget is also generated which will produce all 3 coverage report\ntypes, if possible.\nThe output of these commands is written to the log directory meson-logs in\nyour build directory.\n"});
