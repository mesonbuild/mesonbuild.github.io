This may lead to exported\nsymbols being lost. Most compilers support \"whole archive\" linking\nthat includes all symbols and code of a given static library. This is\nexposed with the link_whole keyword.\nNote that Visual Studio compilers only support this functionality on\nVS 2015 and newer.\n"});
