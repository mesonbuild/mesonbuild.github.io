Subproject dist scripts will only be executed\nwhen running meson dist --include-subprojects. MESON_PROJECT_SOURCE_ROOT,\nMESON_PROJECT_BUILD_ROOT and MESON_PROJECT_DIST_ROOT environment variables\nare set when dist scripts are run. They are identical to MESON_SOURCE_ROOT,\nMESON_BUILD_ROOT and MESON_DIST_ROOT for main project scripts, but for\nsubproject scripts they have the path to the root of the subproject appended,\nusually subprojects/<subproject-name>.\nNote that existing dist scripts likely need to be modified to use those new\nenvironment variables instead of MESON_DIST_ROOT to work properly when used\nfrom a subproject.\n"});
