Because of this Meson allows you to specify a patch URL.\nFor historic reasons this is called a \"patch\", however, it serves as an\noverlay to add or replace files rather than modifying them. The file\nmust be an archive; it is downloaded and automatically extracted into\nthe subproject. The extracted files will include a Meson build\ndefinition for the given subproject.\nThis approach makes it extremely simple to embed dependencies that\nrequire build system changes. You can write the Meson build definition\nfor the dependency in total isolation. This is a lot better than doing\nit inside your own source tree, especially if it contains hundreds of\nthousands of lines of code. Once you have a working build definition,\njust zip up the Meson build files (and others you have changed) and\nput them somewhere where you can download them.\nPrior to 0.55.0 Meson build patches were only supported for\nwrap-file mode. When using wrap-git, the repository must contain all\nMeson build definitions. Since 0.55.0 Meson build patches are\nsupported for any wrap modes, including wrap-git.\n"});
