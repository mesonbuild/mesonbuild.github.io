However, since 0.40.0, the override_options:\nbuild_target() keyword argument can be used to create such a shared_library() by passing\noverride_options: 'b_lundef=false'. Shared modules have other characteristics that make\nthem incompatible with linking, such as a lack of SONAME.\nOn macOS and iOS, linking to shared modules is disallowed by the linker, so we disallow it at\nconfigure time.\nOn Android, if a shared module foo uses symbols from another shared module bar, foo must\nalso be linked to bar. Hence, linking one shared module to another will always be allowed when\nbuilding for Android.\n\n"});
