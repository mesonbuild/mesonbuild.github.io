In order for Meson to download anything from the net\nwhile building, two conditions must be met.\nFirst of all there needs to be a .wrap file with a download URL in\nthe subprojects directory. If one does not exist, Meson will not\ndownload anything.\nThe second requirement is that there needs to be an explicit\nsubproject invocation in your meson.build files. Either\nsubproject('foobar') or dependency('foobar', fallback : ['foobar', 'foo_dep']). If these declarations either are not in any build file\nor they are not called (due to e.g. if/else) then nothing is\ndownloaded.\nIf this is not sufficient for you, starting from release 0.40.0 Meson\nhas an option called wrap-mode which can be used to disable wrap\ndownloads altogether with --wrap-mode=nodownload. You can also\ndisable dependency fallbacks altogether with --wrap-mode=nofallback,\nwhich also implies the nodownload option.\nIf on the other hand, you want Meson to always use the fallback\nfor dependencies, even when an external dependency exists and could\nsatisfy the version requirements, for example in order to make\nsure your project builds when fallbacks are used, you can use\n--wrap-mode=forcefallback since 0.46.0.\n"});
