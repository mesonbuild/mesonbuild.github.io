For functions where this feature is active,\nMeson takes the list of arguments and flattens all nested lists into\none big list.\nFor instance the following function calls to executable() are\nidentical in Meson:\nBecause of an internal implementation detail, the following syntax\nis currently also supported, even though the first argument of\nexecutable() is a single str and not a list:\nThis code is currently accepted because argument flattening currently\nhappens before the parameters are evaluated. \"Support\" for\nsuch constructs will likely be removed in future Meson releases!\nArgument flattening is supported by most but not all Meson\nfunctions and methods. As a general rule, it can be assumed that a\nfunction or method supports argument flattening if the exact list\nstructure is irrelevant to a function.\nWhether a function supports argument flattening is documented in the\nReference Manual.\n"});
