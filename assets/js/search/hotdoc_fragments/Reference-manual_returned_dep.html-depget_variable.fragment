fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_returned_dep.html#depget_variable","fragment":"dep.get_variable()\nA generic variable getter method, which replaces the\nget_*type*_variable methods. This allows one to get the variable\nfrom a dependency without knowing specifically how that dependency\nwas found. If default_value is set and the value cannot be gotten\nfrom the object then default_value is returned, if it is not set\nthen an error is raised.\n\nBefore 1.3.0, specifying multiple pkgconfig_define pairs would silently malform the results. Only the first variable would be redefined, but its value would contain both the second variable name, as well as its value.\n\n"});
