fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Rust.html#mixing-generated-and-static-sources","fragment":"Mixing Generated and Static sources\nNote This feature was added in 0.62\nYou can use a [[structured_source]] for this. Structured sources are a dictionary\nmapping a string of the directory, to a source or list of sources.\nWhen using a structured source all inputs must be listed, as Meson may copy\nthe sources from the source tree to the build tree.\nStructured inputs are generally not needed when not using generated sources.\nAs an implementation detail, Meson will attempt to determine if it needs to copy\nfiles at configure time and will skip copying if it can. Copying is done at\nbuild time (when necessary), to avoid reconfiguring when sources change.\n"});
