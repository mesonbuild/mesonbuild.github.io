The main tool for this is a\ncustom language used to describe the structure of the build. The main\ndesign goals of this language has been simplicity, clarity and\nconciseness. Much inspiration was drawn from the Python programming\nlanguage, which is considered very readable, even to people who have\nnot programmed in Python before.\nAnother main idea has been to provide first class support for modern\nprogramming tools and best practices. These include features as varied\nas unit testing, code coverage reporting, precompiled headers and the\nlike. All of these features should be immediately available to any\nproject using Meson. The user should not need to hunt for third party\nmacros or write shell scripts to get these features. They should just\nwork out of the box.\nThis power should not come at the expense of limited usability. Many\nsoftware builds require unorthodox steps. A common example is that you\nfirst need to build a custom tool and then use that tool to generate\nmore source code to build. This functionality needs to be supported\nand be as easy to use as other parts of the system.\n"});
