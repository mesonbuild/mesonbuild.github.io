Meson will\ndetect this and report these tests as skipped rather than failed. This\nbehavior was added in version 0.37.0.\nFor TAP-based tests, skipped tests should print a single line starting\nwith 1..0 # SKIP.\nIn addition, sometimes a test fails set up so that it should fail even\nif it is marked as an expected failure. The GNU standard approach in\nthis case is to exit the program with error code 99. Again, Meson will\ndetect this and report these tests as ERROR, ignoring the setting of\nshould_fail. This behavior was added in version 0.50.0.\n"});
