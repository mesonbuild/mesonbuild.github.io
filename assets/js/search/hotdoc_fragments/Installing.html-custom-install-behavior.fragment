Meson\nmakes this easy by allowing you to specify a custom script to execute\nat install time. As an example, here is a script that generates an\nempty file in a custom directory.\nAs you can see, Meson sets up some environment variables to help you\nwrite your script (DESTDIR is not set by Meson, it is inherited from\nthe outside environment). In addition to the install prefix, Meson\nalso sets the variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT and MESON_BUILD_ROOT.\nTelling Meson to run this script at install time is a one-liner.\nThe argument is the name of the script file relative to the current\nsubdirectory.\n"});
