It accepts two arguments, -j and -l, which\nare used if possible (-l does nothing with msbuild). A -j or -l\nvalue < 1 lets the backend decide how many threads to use. For msbuild\nthis means -m, for ninja it means passing no arguments.\nAdditionally meson compile provides a --clean switch to clean the\nproject.\nA complete list of arguments is always documented via meson compile --help\n"});
