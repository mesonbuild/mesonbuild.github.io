fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Gnome-module.html#gnomegenerate_gir","fragment":"gnome.generate_gir()\nGenerates GObject introspection data.\nTakes one or more positional arguments:\nEither one or more library objects you want to build gir data for, or a single\nexecutable object.\nThere are several keyword arguments. Many of these map directly to the\ng-ir-scanner tool so see its documentation for more information.\nReturns an array of two elements which are: [gir_target, typelib_target]\n\n\ndependencies: deps to use during introspection scanning\n\ndoc_format: (Added 1.8.0) format of the inline documentation\n\nextra_args: command line arguments to pass to gir compiler\n\nenv: (Added 1.2.0) environment variables to set, such as\n{'NAME1': 'value1', 'NAME2': 'value2'} or ['NAME1=value1', 'NAME2=value2'],\nor an env object which allows more sophisticated environment juggling.\n\nexport_packages: extra packages the gir file exports\n\nsources: the list of sources to be scanned for gir data\n\nnsversion: namespace version\n\nnamespace: the namespace for this gir object which determines\noutput files\n\nidentifier_prefix: the identifier prefix for the gir object,\ne.g. Gtk\n\n\nincludes: list of gir names to be included, can also be a GirTarget\n\nheader: (Added 0.43.0) name of main c header to include for the library,\ne.g. glib.h, (Since 0.61.0) a list of headers is allowed\n\ninclude_directories: extra include paths to look for gir files\n\ninstall: if true, install the generated files\n\ninstall_gir: (Added 0.61.0) overrides install, whether to install the\ngenerated gir\n\ninstall_dir_gir: (Added 0.35.0) which directory to install the\ngir file into; (Deprecated since 0.61.0) can be false to disable installation\n\ninstall_typelib: (Added 0.61.0) overrides install, whether to install the\ngenerated typelib\n\ninstall_dir_typelib: (Added 0.35.0) which directory to install\nthe typelib file into; (Deprecated since 0.61.0) can be false to disable installation\n\nlink_with: list of libraries to link with\n\nsymbol_prefix: the symbol prefix for the gir object, e.g. gtk,\n(Since 0.43.0) an ordered list of multiple prefixes is allowed\n\nfatal_warnings: Since 0.55.0 turn scanner warnings into fatal errors.\n\n"});
