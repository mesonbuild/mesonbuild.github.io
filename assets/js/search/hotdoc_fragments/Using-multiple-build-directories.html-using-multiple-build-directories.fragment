This means that all files generated during the build\nare placed in a separate subdirectory. This goes against common Unix\ntradition where you build your projects in-source. Building out of\nsource gives two major advantages.\nFirst of all this makes for very simple VCS \"ignore\" files. In\nclassical build systems you may need to have tens of lines of\ndefinitions, most of which contain wildcards. When doing out of source\nbuilds all of this busywork goes away. A common ignore file for a\nMeson project only contains a few lines that are the build directory\nand IDE project files. (Note that since Meson 0.57.0, build directories\nare automatically ignored for git and mercurial by generating an ignore\nfile inside the build directory.)\nSecondly this makes it very easy to clean your projects: just delete\nthe build subdirectory and you are done. There is no need to guess\nwhether you need to run make clean, make distclean, make mrproper or something else. When you delete a build subdirectory\nthere is no possible way to have any lingering state from your old\nbuilds.\nThe true benefit comes from somewhere else, though.\n"});
