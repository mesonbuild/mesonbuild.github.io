In some cases it\nmight be useful to have an option that has the same value in both of\nthem. This can be achieved with the yield keyword. Suppose you have\nan option definition like this:\nIf you build this project on its own, this option behaves like\nusual. However if you build this project as a subproject of another\nproject which also has an option called some_option, then calling\nget_option returns the value of the superproject. If the value of\nyield is false, get_option returns the value of the subproject's\noption.\nSince 1.8.0 -Dsub:some_option=anothervalue, when used with a\nyielding option, sets the value separately from the option\nit yields to.\n"});
