This can be\ntriggered using meson --reconfigure. Previous source tree is not deleted, to\nprevent from any loss of local changes. Since 0.58.0 If --reset is\nspecified, the source tree is deleted and new source is extracted.\nIf subproject is currently in detached mode, a checkout of the revision from\nwrap file is performed. Since 0.56.0 a rebase is also performed in case the\nrevision already existed locally but was outdated. If --reset is specified,\na hard reset is performed instead of rebase.\nIf subproject is currently at the same branch as specified by the wrap file,\na rebase on origin commit is performed. Since 0.56.0 If --reset is\nspecified, a hard reset is performed instead of rebase.\nIf subproject is currently in a different branch as specified by the wrap file,\nit is skipped unless --rebase option is passed in which case a rebase on\norigin commit is performed. Since 0.56.0 the --rebase argument is\ndeprecated and has no effect. Instead, a checkout of the revision from wrap file\nfile is performed and a rebase is also performed in case the revision already\nexisted locally by was outdated. If --reset is specified, a hard reset is\nperformed instead of rebase.\n\nSince 0.56.0 if the url specified in wrap file is different to the URL set\non origin for a git repository it will not be updated, unless --reset is\nspecified in which case the URL of origin will be reset first.\n\nSince 0.56.0 If the subproject directory is not a git repository but has a\n[wrap-git] the subproject is ignored, unless --reset is specified in which\ncase the directory is deleted and the new repository is cloned.\n\n"});
