It now also sets QEMU_LD_PREFIX to the\nsys_root value from cross file if property is defined. That means that cross\ncompiled executables can often be run transparently on the build machine, for\nexample when cross compiling for aarch64 linux from x86_64 linux.\nA new argument --workdir has been added, by default it is set to build\ndirectory. For example, meson devenv -C builddir --workdir . can be used to\nremain in the current dir (often source dir) instead.\n--dump now prints shell commands like FOO=\"/prepend/path:$FOO:/append/path\",\nusing the literal $FOO instead of current value of FOO from environment.\nThis makes easier to evaluate those expressions in a different environment.\n"});
