Because dependencies are\nlanguage-specific, you must specify the requested language using the\nlanguage keyword argument, i.e.,\nMeson prefers pkg-config for MPI, but if your MPI implementation does\nnot provide them, it will search for the standard wrapper executables,\nmpic, mpicxx, mpic++, mpifort, mpif90, mpif77. If these\nare not in your path, they can be specified by setting the standard\nenvironment variables MPICC, MPICXX, MPIFC, MPIF90, or\nMPIF77, during configuration. It will also try to use the Microsoft\nimplementation on windows via the system method.\nmethod may be auto, config-tool, pkg-config or system.\nNew in 0.54.0 The config-tool and system method values. Previous\nversions would always try pkg-config, then config-tool, then system.\n\n\ndependency('mpi', language: 'c') for the C MPI headers and libraries\n\ndependency('mpi', language: 'cpp') for the C++ MPI headers and libraries\n\ndependency('mpi', language: 'fortran') for the Fortran MPI headers and libraries\n\n"});
