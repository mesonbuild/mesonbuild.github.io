The\nfollowing functions will then be available as methods on the object\nwith the name cmake. You can, of course, replace the name cmake\nwith anything else.\nIt is generally recommended to use the latest Meson version and\nCMake >=3.17 for best compatibility. CMake subprojects will\nusually also work with older CMake versions. However, this can\nlead to unexpected issues in rare cases.\n"});
