Note: relative path for a target specified in the root meson.build is ./.\nTYPE: type of the target (e.g. shared_library, executable and etc)\nPATH and/or TYPE can be omitted if the resulting TARGET can be used to uniquely identify the target in meson.build.\nFor example targets from the following code:\ncan be invoked with meson compile foo:shared_library foo:static_library bar.\n"});
