fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#add_languages","fragment":"add_languages()\nAdd programming languages used by the project.\nThis is equivalent to having\nthem in the project declaration. This function is usually used to\nadd languages that are only used under some conditions.\nReturns true if all languages specified were found and false otherwise.\nIf native is omitted, the languages may be used for either build or host\nmachine, but are never required for the build machine.  (i.e. it is equivalent\nto add_languages(*langs*, native: false, required: *required*) and add_languages(*langs*, native: true, required: false). This default behaviour\nmay change to native: false in a future Meson version.\n\n\n"});
