In 1.8 this was changed to a free-form array of options where\navailable sanitizers are not hardcoded anymore but instead verified via a\ncompiler check.\nThis solves a number of longstanding issues such as:\nTo not break backwards compatibility, calling get_option('b_sanitize')\ncontinues to return the configured value as a string, with a guarantee that\naddress,undefined remains ordered.\n\nSanitizers may be supported by a compiler, but not on a specific platform\n(OpenBSD).\nNew sanitizers are not recognized by Meson.\nUsing sanitizers in previously-unsupported combinations.\n\n"});
