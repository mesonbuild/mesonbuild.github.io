fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Using-the-WrapDB.html#page-description","fragment":"The Wrap database is a web service that provides Meson build\ndefinitions to projects that do not have it natively. Using it is\nsimple. The service can be found\nhere.\nThe front page lists all projects that are on the service. Select the\none you want and click it. The detail page lists available versions by\nbranch and revision id. The branch names come from upstream releases\nand revision ids are version numbers internal to the database.\nWhenever the packaging is updated a new revision is released to the\nservice a new revision with a bigger revision id is added. Usually you\nwant to select the newest branch with the highest revision id.\nYou can get the actual wrap file which tells Meson how to fetch the\nproject by clicking on the download link on the page. As an example,\nthe wrap file for zlib-1.2.8, revision\n4\nlooks like this. You can find detailed documentation about it in the\nWrap manual.\nAdd this file to your project with the name subprojects/zlib.wrap.\nThen you can use it in your meson.build file with this directive:\nWhen Meson encounters this it will automatically download, unpack and\npatch the source files.\nThe contents of the Wrap database are tracked in git repos of the\nMesonbuild project. The actual\nprocess is simple and described in submission\ndocumentation.\n"});
