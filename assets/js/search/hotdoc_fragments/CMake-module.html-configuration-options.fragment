It\nis generated by the subproject_options function\nAll configuration options have to be set before the subproject is\nconfigured and must be passed to the subproject method via the\noptions key. Altering the configuration object won't have any effect\non previous cmake.subproject calls.\nIn earlier Meson versions CMake command-line parameters could be set\nwith the cmake_options kwarg. However, this feature is deprecated\nsince 0.55.0 and only kept for compatibility. It will not work\ntogether with the options kwarg.\n"});
