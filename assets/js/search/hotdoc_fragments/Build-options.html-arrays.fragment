fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Build-options.html#arrays","fragment":"Arrays\nArrays represent an array of strings. By default the array can contain\narbitrary strings. To limit the possible values that can be used set the\nchoices parameter. Meson will then only allow the value array to\ncontain strings that are in the given list. The array may be\nempty. The value parameter specifies the default value of the option\nand if it is unset then the values of choices will be used as the\ndefault.\nAs of 0.47.0 -Dopt= and -Dopt=[] both pass an empty list, before this\n-Dopt= would pass a list with an empty string.\nThis type is available since version 0.44.0\n"});
