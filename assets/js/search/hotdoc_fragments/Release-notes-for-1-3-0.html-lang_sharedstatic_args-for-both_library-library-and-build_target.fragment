This\nallows a both_libraries() to have arguments specific to either the shared or\nstatic library, as well as common arguments to both.\nThere is a drawback to this, since Meson now cannot re-use object files between\nthe static and shared targets. This could lead to much higher compilation time\nwhen using a both_libraries() if there are many sources.\n"});
