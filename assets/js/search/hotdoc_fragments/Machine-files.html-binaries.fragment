fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Machine-files.html#binaries","fragment":"Binaries\nThe binaries section contains a list of binaries. These can be used\ninternally by Meson, or by the find_program function.\nThese values must be either strings or an array of strings\nCompilers and linkers are defined here using <lang> and <lang>_ld.\n<lang>_ld is special because it is compiler specific. For compilers\nlike gcc and clang which are used to invoke the linker this is a value\nto pass to their \"choose the linker\" argument (-fuse-ld= in this\ncase). For compilers like MSVC and Clang-Cl, this is the path to a\nlinker for Meson to invoke, such as link.exe or lld-link.exe.\nSupport for ld is new in 0.53.0\nchanged in 0.53.1 the ld variable was replaced by <lang>_ld,\nbecause it regressed a large number of projects. in 0.53.0 the ld\nvariable was used instead.\nNative example:\nCross example:\nAn incomplete list of internally used programs that can be overridden\nhere is:\n\ncmake\ncups-config\ngnustep-config\ngpgme-config\nlibgcrypt-config\nlibwmf-config\nllvm-config\npcap-config\npkgconfig\nsdl2-config\nwx-config (or wx-3.0-config or wx-config-gtk)\n\n"});
