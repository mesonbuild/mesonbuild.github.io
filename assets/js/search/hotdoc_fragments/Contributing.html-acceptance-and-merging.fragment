All pull requests must be reviewed and\naccepted by someone with commit rights who is not the original\nsubmitter. Merge requests can be roughly split into three different\ncategories.\nThe first one consists of MRs that only change the markdown\ndocumentation under docs/markdown. Anyone with access rights can\npush changes to these directly to master. For major changes it is\nstill recommended to create a MR so other people can comment on it.\nThe second group consists of merges that don't change any\nfunctionality, fixes to the CI system and bug fixes that have added\nregression tests (see below) and don't change existing\nfunctionality. Once successfully reviewed anyone with merge rights can\nmerge these to master.\nThe final kind of merges are those that add new functionality or\nchange existing functionality in a backwards incompatible way. These\nrequire the approval of the project lead.\nIn a simplified list form the split would look like the following:\n\nmembers with commit access can do:\n\ndocumentation changes (directly to master if warranted)\nbug fixes that don't change functionality\nrefactorings\nnew dependency types\nnew tool support (e.g. a new Doxygen-kind of tool)\nsupport for new compilers to existing languages\n\n\nproject leader decision is needed for:\n\nnew modules\nnew functions in the Meson language\nsyntax changes for Meson files\nchanges breaking backwards compatibility\nsupport for new languages\n\n\n\n\ndocumentation changes (directly to master if warranted)\nbug fixes that don't change functionality\nrefactorings\nnew dependency types\nnew tool support (e.g. a new Doxygen-kind of tool)\nsupport for new compilers to existing languages\n\n\nnew modules\nnew functions in the Meson language\nsyntax changes for Meson files\nchanges breaking backwards compatibility\nsupport for new languages\n\n"});
