fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Dependencies.html#shaderc","fragment":"Shaderc\n(added 0.51.0)\nMeson will first attempt to find shaderc using pkg-config. Upstream\ncurrently ships three different pkg-config files and by default will\ncheck them in this order: shaderc, shaderc_combined, and\nshaderc_static. If the static keyword argument is true, then\nMeson instead checks in this order: shaderc_combined, shaderc_static,\nand shaderc.\nIf no pkg-config file is found, then Meson will try to detect the\nlibrary manually. In this case, it will try to link against either\n-lshaderc_shared or -lshaderc_combined, preferring the latter\nif the static keyword argument is true. Note that it is not possible\nto obtain the shaderc version using this method.\nmethod may be auto, pkg-config or system.\n"});
