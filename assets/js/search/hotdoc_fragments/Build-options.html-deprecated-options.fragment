It is also possible to deprecate only some of the choices, and map\ndeprecated values to a new value.\nSince 0.63.0 the deprecated keyword argument can take the name of a new option\nthat replace this option. In that case, setting a value on the deprecated option\nwill set the value on both the old and new names, assuming they accept the same\nvalues.\n"});
