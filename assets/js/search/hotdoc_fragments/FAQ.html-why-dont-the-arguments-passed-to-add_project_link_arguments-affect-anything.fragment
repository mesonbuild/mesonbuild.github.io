In this Meson is working as expected, since meson will\nattempt to determine the correct linker to use automatically. This avoids\nsituations like in autotools where dummy C++ sources have to be added to some\ncompilation targets to get correct linkage. So in the above case the C++ linker\nis used, instead of the C linker, as helper.cpp likely cannot be linked using\nthe C linker.\nGenerally the best way to resolve this is to add the cpp language to the\nadd_project_link_arguments call.\nTo force the use of the C linker anyway the link_language keyword argument can\nbe used. Note that this can result in a compilation failure if there are symbols\nthat the C linker cannot resolve.\n"});
