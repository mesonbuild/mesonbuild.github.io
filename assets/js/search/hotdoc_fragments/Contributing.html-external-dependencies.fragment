The user\nexperience should be \"get Python3 and Ninja, run\", even on\nWindows. Unfortunately this means that we can't have dependencies on\nprojects outside of Python's standard library. This applies only to\ncore functionality, though. For additional helper programs etc the use\nof external dependencies may be ok. If you feel that you are dealing\nwith this kind of case, please contact the developers first with your\nuse case.\n"});
