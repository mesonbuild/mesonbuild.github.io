Similarly bug fixes must come\nwith a unit test that demonstrates the bug, proves that it has been\nfixed and prevents the feature from breaking in the future.\nSometimes it is difficult to create a unit test for a given bug. If\nthis is the case, note this in your pull request. We may permit bug\nfix merge requests in these cases. This is done on a case by case\nbasis. Sometimes it may be easier to write the test than convince the\nmaintainers that one is not needed. Exercise judgment and ask for help\nin problematic cases.\nThe tests are split into two different parts: unit tests and full\nproject tests. To run all tests, execute ./run_tests.py. Unit tests\ncan be run with ./run_unittests.py and project tests with\n./run_project_tests.py.\n"});
