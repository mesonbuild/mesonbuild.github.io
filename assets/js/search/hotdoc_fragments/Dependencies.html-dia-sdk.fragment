fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Dependencies.html#dia-sdk","fragment":"DIA SDK\n(added 1.6.0)\nMicrosoft's Debug Interface Access SDK (DIA SDK) is available only on Windows,\nwhen using msvc, clang-cl or clang compiler from Microsoft Visual Studio.\nThe DIA SDK runtime is not statically linked to target. The default usage\nmethod requires the runtime DLL (msdiaXXX.dll) to be manually registered in the\nOS with regsrv32.exe command, so it can be loaded using CoCreateInstance\nWindows function.\nAlternatively, you can use meson to copy the DIA runtime DLL to your build\ndirectory, and load it dynamically using NoRegCoCreate function provided by\nthe DIA SDK. To facilitate this, you can read DLL path from dependency's\nvariable 'dll' and use fs module to copy it. Example:\nOnly the major version is available (eg. version is 14 for msdia140.dll).\n"});
