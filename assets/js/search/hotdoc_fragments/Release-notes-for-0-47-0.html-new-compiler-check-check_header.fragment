fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Release-notes-for-0-47-0.html#new-compiler-check-check_header","fragment":"New compiler check: check_header()\n\nThe existing compiler check has_header() only checks if the header\nexists, either with the __has_include C++11 builtin, or by running\nthe pre-processor.\nHowever, sometimes the header you are looking for is unusable on some\nplatforms or with some compilers in a way that is only detectable at\ncompile-time. For such cases, you should use check_header() which\nwill include the header and run a full compile.\nNote that has_header() is much faster than check_header(), so it\nshould be used whenever possible.\n"});
