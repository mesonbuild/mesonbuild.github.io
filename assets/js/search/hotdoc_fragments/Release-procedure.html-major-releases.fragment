fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Release-procedure.html#major-releases","fragment":"Major releases\nMajor releases are currently in the form 0.X.0, where X is an\nincreasing number. We aim to do a major release roughly once a month,\nthough the schedule is not set in stone.\nBefore a major release is made a stable branch will be made, and\n0.X.0-rc1 release candidate will be made. A new milestone for 0.X.0\nwill be made, and all bugs effecting the RC will be assigned to this\nmilestone. Patches fixing bugs in the milestone will be picked to the\nstable branch, and normal development will continue on the master\nbranch. Every week after this a new release candidate will be\nmade until all bugs are resolved in that milestone. When all of the\nbugs are fixed the 0.X.0 release will be made.\n"});
