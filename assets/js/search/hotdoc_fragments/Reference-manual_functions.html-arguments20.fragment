The function will check for the arguments one by one and the\nfirst one that is found is returned.\n(since 0.37.0)\n\nFinally, find_program()\naccepts the following keyword arguments:\nextra list of absolute paths where to look for program names.\n(since 0.53.0)\nIf true and the program couldn't be found, return a disabler object\ninstead of a not-found object.\n(since 0.49.0)\ndefault =\n  false\nDefines how this executable should be searched.
