All the error logs are printed rather than only\nthe first ten.\nif --verbose is specified and --num-processes specifies more than\none concurrent test, test output is buffered and printed after the\ntest finishes.\nthe console logs include a reproducer command.  If --verbose is\nspecified, the command is printed for all tests at the time they start;\notherwise, it is printed for failing tests at the time the test finishes.\nfor TAP and Rust tests, Meson is able to report individual subtests.  If\n--verbose is specified, all tests are reported.  If --print-errorlogs\nis specified, only failures are.\nIn addition, if --verbose was specified, Meson used not to generate\nlogs.  This limitation has now been removed.\nThese changes make the default ninja test output more readable, while\n--verbose output provides detailed, human-readable logs that\nare well suited to CI environments.\n\n\nif stdout is a tty, meson includes a progress report.\n\n\nif --print-errorlogs is specified, the logs are printed as tests run\nrather than afterwards.
