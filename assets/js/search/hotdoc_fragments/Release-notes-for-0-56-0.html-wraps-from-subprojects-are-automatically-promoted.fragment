When configuring a subproject, Meson will look for\nany wrap file or directory in the subproject's subprojects/\ndirectory and add them into the global list of available subprojects,\nto be used by any future subproject() call or dependency()\nfallback. If a subproject with the same name already exists, the new\nwrap file or directory is ignored. That means that the main project\ncan always override any subproject's wrap files by providing their\nown, it also means the ordering in which subprojects are configured\nmatters, if 2 subprojects provide foo.wrap only the one from the first\nsubproject to be configured will be used.\nThis new behavior can be disabled by passing --wrap-mode=nopromote.\n"});
