For example you could not have two executables\nnamed foo. This requirement is now relaxed so that you can have\nmultiple targets with the same name, as long as they are in different\nsubdirectories.\nNote that projects that have multiple targets with the same name can\nnot be built with the flat layout or any backend that writes outputs\nin the same directory.\n"});
