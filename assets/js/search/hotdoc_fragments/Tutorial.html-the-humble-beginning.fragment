First we create a file main.c which holds the source. It looks like this. \nThen we create a Meson build description and put it in a file called meson.build in the same directory. Its contents are the following. \nThat is all. We are now ready to build our application. First we need to initialize the build by going into the source directory and issuing the following commands. \nWe create a separate build directory to hold all of the compiler output. Meson is different from some other build systems in that it does not permit in source builds. You must always create a separate build directory. Common convention is to put the default build directory in a subdirectory of your top level source directory. \nWhen Meson is run it prints the following output. \nNow we are ready to build our code. \nOnce that is done we can run the resulting binary. \nThis produces the expected output. \n"});
