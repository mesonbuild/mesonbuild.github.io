First we create a file main.c which holds the source. It\nlooks like this.\nThen we create a Meson build description and put it in a file called\nmeson.build in the same directory. Its contents are the following.\nThat is all. Note that unlike Autotools you do not need to add any\nsource headers to the list of\nsources.\nWe are now ready to build our application. First we need\nto initialize the build by going into the source directory and issuing\nthe following commands.\nWe create a separate build directory to hold all of the compiler\noutput. Meson is different from some other build systems in that it\ndoes not permit in-source builds. You must always create a separate\nbuild directory. Common convention is to put the default build\ndirectory in a subdirectory of your top level source directory.\nWhen Meson is run it prints the following output.\nNow we are ready to build our code.\nIf your Meson version is newer than 0.55.0, you can use the new\nbackend-agnostic build command:\nFor the rest of this document we are going to use the latter form.\nOnce the executable is built we can run it.\nThis produces the expected output.\n"});
