This ruled out tens of potential project names. At\nsome point the name Gluon was considered. Gluons are elementary\nparticles that hold protons and neutrons together, much like a build\nsystem's job is to take pieces of source code and a compiler and bind\nthem to a complete whole.\nUnfortunately this name was taken, too. Then the rest of subatomic\nparticles were examined and Meson was found to be available.\n"});
