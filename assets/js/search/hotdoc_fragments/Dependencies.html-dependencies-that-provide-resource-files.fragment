For example, wayland-protocols XML files.\nSince 0.63.0 these actually work as expected, even when they come from a\n(well-formed) internal dependency. This only works when treating the files to\nbe obtained as interchangeable with a system dependency -- e.g. only public\nfiles may be used, and leaving the directory pointed to by the dependency is\nnot allowed.\n"});
