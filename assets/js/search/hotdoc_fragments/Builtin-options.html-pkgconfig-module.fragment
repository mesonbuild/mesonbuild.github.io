fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Builtin-options.html#pkgconfig-module","fragment":"Pkgconfig module\nSince 0.63.0 The pkgconfig.relocatable option is used by the\npkgconfig module–namely pkg.generate()–and\naffects how the prefix (not to be confused with the\ninstall prefix) in the generated pkgconfig file is set.\nWhen it is true, the prefix will be relative to the install_dir-this\nallows the pkgconfig file to be moved around and still work, as long\nas the relative path is not broken. In general, this allows for the whole\ninstalled package to be placed anywhere on the system and still work as a\ndependency. When it is set to false, the prefix will be the same as\nthe install prefix.\nAn error will be raised if pkgconfig.relocatable is true and the\ninstall_dir for a generated pkgconfig file points outside the\ninstall prefix. For example: if the install prefix is /usr and the\ninstall_dir for a pkgconfig file is /var/lib/pkgconfig.\n\n\n\n Option\n Default value\n Possible values\n Description\n\n\n\n\n relocatable\n false\n true, false\n Generate the pkgconfig files as relocatable (Since 0.63.0)\n\n\n\n"});
