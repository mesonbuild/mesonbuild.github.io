fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Builtin-options.html#pkgconfig-module","fragment":"Pkgconfig module\nSince 0.63.0 The pkgconfig.relocatable option is used by the\npkgconfig module, namely pkg.generate() and affect how the\nprefix in the generated pkgconfig file is set (not to be confused\nwith the install prefix). When it is true the prefix will be\nrelative to the install_dir. This allows the pkgconfig file to be\nmoved around and still work, as long as the relative path is not\nbroken. In general this allows for the whole installed package to be\nplaced anywhere on the system and still work as a dependency. When it\nis set to false the prefix will be the same as the install prefix.\nAn error will be raised if pkgconfig.relocatable is true and the\ninstall_dir for a generated pkgconfig file points outside the\ninstall prefix. For example if the install prefix is /usr and the\ninstall_dir for a pkgconfig file is /var/lib/pkgconfig.\n\n\n\n Option\n Default value\n Possible values\n Description\n\n\n\n\n relocatable\n false\n true, false\n Generate the pkgconfig files as relocatable (Since 0.63.0)\n\n\n\n"});
