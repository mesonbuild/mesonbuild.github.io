Previously it was only\npossible to install all of them in the same directory, but now you can\ninstall each output in its own directory like this:\nFor backwards compatibility and for conciseness, if you only specify\none directory all outputs will be installed into it.\nThe same feature is also available for Vala build targets. For\ninstance, to install a shared library built by valac, the generated\nheader, and the generated VAPI (respectively) into the default\nlocations, you can do:\nTo install any of the three in a custom directory, just pass it as a\nstring instead of true. To not install it, pass false. You can\nalso pass a single string (as before) and it will cause only the\nlibrary to be installed, so this is a backwards-compatible change.\n"});
