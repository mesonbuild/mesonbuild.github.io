fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Vala.html#libraries-without-pkgconfig-files","fragment":"Libraries without pkg-config files\nA library that does not have a corresponding pkg-config file may mean\ndependency() is unsuitable for finding the C and Vala interface\nfiles. In this case it is necessary to use the find_library() method\nof the compiler object.\nThe first example uses Vala's POSIX binding. There is no pkg-config\nfile because POSIX includes the standard C library on Unix systems.\nAll that is needed is the VAPI file, posix.vapi. This is included\nwith Vala and installed in Vala's standard search path. Meson just\nneeds to be told to only find the library for the Vala compiler:\nThe next example shows how to link with a C library where no\nadditional VAPI is needed. The standard maths functions are already\nbound in glib-2.0.vapi, but the GNU C library requires linking to\nthe maths library separately. In this example Meson is told to find\nthe library only for the C compiler:\nThe required: false means the build will continue when using another\nC library that does not separate the maths library. See Add math\nlibrary (-lm) portably.\nThe final example shows how to use a library that does not have a\npkg-config file and the VAPI is in the vapi directory of your\nproject source files:\nThe find_library() method of the C compiler object will try to find the C\nheader files and the library to link with.\nThe find_library() method of the Vala compiler object needs to have the dir\nkeyword added to include the project VAPI directory. This is not added\nautomatically by add_project_arguments().\n"});
