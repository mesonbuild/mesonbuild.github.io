fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Builtin-options.html#specifying-options-per-machine","fragment":"Specifying options per machine\nSince 0.51.0, some options are specified per machine rather than\nglobally for all machine configurations. Prefixing the option with\nbuild. just affects the build machine configuration, while\nunprefixed just affects the host machine configuration, respectively.\nFor example:\nbuild.pkg_config_path controls the paths pkg-config will search\nfor just native: true dependencies (build machine).\npkg_config_path controls the paths pkg-config will search for\njust native: false dependencies (host machine).\nThis is useful for cross builds. In the native builds, build = host,\nand the unprefixed option alone will suffice.\nPrior to 0.51.0, these options just effected native builds when\nspecified on the command line, as there was no build. prefix.\nSimilarly named fields in the [properties] section of the cross file\nwould effect cross compilers, but the code paths were fairly different\nallowing differences in behavior to crop out.\n\n\nbuild.pkg_config_path controls the paths pkg-config will search\nfor just native: true dependencies (build machine).\n\n\npkg_config_path controls the paths pkg-config will search for\njust native: false dependencies (host machine).\n\n\n"});
