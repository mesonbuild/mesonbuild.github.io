fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Builtin-options.html#specifying-options-per-machine","fragment":"Specifying options per machine\nSince 0.51.0, some options are specified per machine rather than\nglobally for all machine configurations. Prefixing the option with\nbuild. only affects the build machine configuration, while leaving it\nunprefixed only affects the host machine configuration.\nFor example:\nbuild.pkg_config_path controls the paths pkg-config will search\nfor native: true (build machine) dependencies.\npkg_config_path controls the paths pkg-config will search for\nnative: false (host machine) dependencies.\nThis is useful for cross builds. In native builds, the build and host\nmachines are the same, and the unprefixed option alone will suffice.\nPrior to 0.51.0, these options only affected native builds when\nspecified on the command line as there was no build. prefix.\nSimilarly named fields in the [properties] section of the cross file\nwould affect cross compilers, but the code paths were fairly different,\nallowing differences in behavior to crop out.\n\n\nbuild.pkg_config_path controls the paths pkg-config will search\nfor native: true (build machine) dependencies.\n\n\npkg_config_path controls the paths pkg-config will search for\nnative: false (host machine) dependencies.\n\n\n"});
