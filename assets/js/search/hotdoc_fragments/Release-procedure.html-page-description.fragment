The following procedure is not yet approved for use\nMeson operates under the principle that trunk should (in theory) be\nalways good enough for release. That is, all code merged in trunk must\npass all unit tests. Any broken code should either be fixed or\nreverted immediately.\nPeople who are willing to tolerate the occasional glitch should be\nable to use Meson trunk for their day to day development if they so\nchoose.\nMajor releases are currently in the form 0.X.0, where X is an\nincreasing number. We aim to do a major release roughly once a month,\nthough the schedule is not set in stone.\nBefore a major release is made a stable branch will be made, and\n0.X.0-rc1 release candidate will be made. A new milestone for 0.X.0\nwill be made, and all bugs effecting the RC will be assigned to this\nmilestone. Patches fixing bugs in the milestone will be picked to the\nstable branch, and normal development will continue on the master\nbranch. Every week after after this a new release candidate will be\nmade until all bugs are resolved in that milestone. When all of the\nbugs are fixed the 0.X.0 release will be made.\nBugfix releases contain only minor fixes to major releases and are\ndesignated by incrementing the last digit of the version number. The\ncriteria for a bug fix release is one of the following:\nIn these cases a bug fix release can be made. It shall contain only\nthe fix for the issue (or issues) in question and other minor bug\nfixes. Only changes that have already landed in trunk will be\nconsidered for inclusion. No new functionality shall be added.\nThe process for requesting that a bug fix release be made goes roughly\nas follows:\nThe request should contain the following information:\nThere is no need to write a long and complicated request report.\nSomething like the following is sufficient:\nThe latest release has a regression where trying to do Foo using Bar\nbreaks. This breaks all projects that use both, which includes at\nleast [list of affected projects]. This causes problems for X amount\nof people and because of this we should do a bugfix release.\n\nrelease has a major regression compared to the previous release (making\nexisting projects unbuildable)\nthe release has a serious bug causing data loss or equivalent\nother unforeseen major issue\n\n\nfile a bug about the core issue\nfile a patch fixing it if possible\ncontact the development team and request a bug fix release (IRC is the\npreferred contact medium)\n\n\nthe issue in question\nwhether it has already caused problems for real projects\nan estimate of how many people and projects will be affected\n\n"});
