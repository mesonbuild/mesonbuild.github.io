The compiler can either be a built target:\nOr an external program provided by the system, or script inside the\nsource tree:\nCustom targets can take zero or more input files and use them to\ngenerate one or more output files. Using a custom target, you can run\nthis compiler at build time to generate the sources:\nThe @INPUT@ there will be transformed to 'somefile1.c' 'file2.c'. Just like the output, you can also refer to each input\nfile individually by index.\nThen you just put that in your program and you're done.\n"});
