If you want to\nignore mingw compilers, pass the --vsenv option on the meson command line.\nIf you need to guarantee a specific Visual Studio version, set it up manually.\nYou can always find the Visual Studio Command Prompt by searching from\nthe Start Menu. However, the name is different for each Visual Studio\nversion. With Visual Studio 2019, look for \"x64 Native Tools Command\nPrompt for VS 2019\". The next steps are the same as\nalways:\nIf you wish to generate Visual Studio project files, pass --backend vs. At the time of writing the Ninja backend is more mature than the\nVS backend so you might want to use it for serious work.\n"});
