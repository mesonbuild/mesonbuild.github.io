If your\ncrate dependencies are properly expressed in Meson, there should be no\nneed for extern crate statements in your Rust code.\nAn example of the problems with extern crate is that if you delete a\ncrate from a Meson build file, other crates that depend on that crate\nusing extern crate might continue linking with the leftover rlib of\nthe deleted crate rather than failing to build, until the build\ndirectory is cleaned.\nThis limitation could be resolved in future with rustc improvements,\nfor example if the -Z binary-dep-depinfo\nfeature is stabilized.\n"});
