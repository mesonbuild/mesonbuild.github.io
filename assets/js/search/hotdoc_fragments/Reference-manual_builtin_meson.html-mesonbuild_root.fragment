fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_builtin_meson.html#mesonbuild_root","fragment":"meson.build_root()\nReturns a string with the absolute path to the build root directory.\nThis function will return the\nbuild root of the parent project if called from a subproject, which is usually\nnot what you want. Try using meson.current_build_dir() or meson.project_build_root().\nIn the rare cases where the root of the main project is needed,\nuse meson.global_build_root() that has the same behaviour but with a more explicit\nname.\n\n\n\n"});
