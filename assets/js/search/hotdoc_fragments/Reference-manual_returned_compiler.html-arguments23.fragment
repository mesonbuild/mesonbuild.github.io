The following types are supported:\nThese input files can be sources, objects, libraries, or any other\nfile. Meson will automatically categorize them based on the extension\nand use them accordingly. For instance, sources (.c, .cpp,\n.vala, .rs, etc) will be compiled and objects (.o, .obj) and\nlibraries (.so, .dll, etc) will be linked.\nWith the Ninja backend, Meson will create a build-time order-only\ndependency on\nall generated input files, including unknown files. This is needed to\nbootstrap the generation of the real dependencies in the\ndepfile generated\nby your compiler to determine when to rebuild sources. Ninja relies on\nthis dependency file for all input files, generated and non-generated.\nThe behavior is similar for other backends.\n\nThe method compiler.preprocess()\naccepts the following keyword arguments:\n\n\n\nStrings relative to the current source directory\n\nfile objects defined in any preceding build file\nThe return value of configure-time generators such as configure_file()\n\nThe return value of build-time generators such as\ncustom_target() or generator.process()\n\n\n\n    \n      \n        Name\n        Type\n        Description\n        Tags\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        compile_args\n        \nlist[str]\n        \n        \nExtra flags to pass to the preprocessor\n  \n        \n\n  \n  \n      \n      \n        dependencies\n        \ndep | list[dep]\n        \n        \nAdditionally dependencies required.\n  \n        \n\n  (since 1.1.0)\n  \n  \n      \n      \n        include_directories\n        \ninc | list[inc]\n        \n        \nExtra directories for header searches.\n  \n        \n\n  (since 0.38.0)\n  \n  \n      \n      \n        output\n        str\n        \n        \nTemplate for name of preprocessed files: @PLAINNAME@ is replaced by\nthe source filename and @BASENAME@ is replaced by the source filename\nwithout its extension.\n  \n        \n\n  \n  \n      \n    \n  \n"});
