fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Codegen-module.html#yaccgenerate","fragment":"yacc.generate\nThis function wraps bison, yacc, byacc, and win_bison (on Windows), and attempts to abstract away the differences between them\nThis requires an input file, which may be a string, File, or generated source. It additionally takes the following options keyword arguments:\nThe outputs will be in the form source header [locations], which means those can be accessed by indexing the output of the yacc call:\n\n\nversion: Version constraints on the lexer\n\nargs: An array of extra arguments to pass the lexer\n\nplainname: If set to true then @PLAINNAME@ will be used as the source base, otherwise @BASENAME@.\n\nsource: the name of the source output. If this is unset Meson will use {base}.{ext} with an extension of cpp if the input has an extension of .yy or c otherwise, with base being determined by the plainname argument.\n\nheader: the name of the header output. If this is unset Meson will use {base}.{ext} with an extension of hpp if the input has an extension of .yy or h otherwise, with base being determined by the plainname argument.\n\nlocations: The name of the locations file, if one is generated. Due to the way yacc works this must be duplicated in the file and in the command.\n\n"});
