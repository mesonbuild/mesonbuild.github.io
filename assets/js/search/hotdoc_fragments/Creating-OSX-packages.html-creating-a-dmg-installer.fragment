A good description can be found\non this page. Please read it\nand create a template image file according to its instructions.\nThe actual process of creating the installer is very simple: you mount\nthe template image, copy your app bundle in it, unmount it and convert\nthe image into a compressed archive. The actual commands to do this\nare not particularly interesting, feel free to steal them from either\nthe linked page above or from the sample script in Meson's test suite.\n"});
