Then you\nwill need the llvm toolset extension for visual\nstudio.\nYou then need to either use a native file\nor set CC=clang-cl, and set CXX=clang-cl to use those compilers, Meson\nwill do the rest.\nThis only works with visual studio 2017 and 2019.\nThere is currently no support in Meson for clang/c2.\n"});
