This can be done by running meson introspect --scan-dependencies /path/to/meson.build.\nThe output format is as follows:\nThe required keyword specifies whether the dependency is marked as\nrequired in the meson.build (all dependencies are required by\ndefault). The conditional key indicates whether the dependency()\nfunction was called inside a conditional block. In a real Meson run\nthese dependencies might not be used, thus they may not be required,\neven if the required key is set. The has_fallback key just\nindicates whether a fallback was directly set in the dependency()\nfunction. The version key always contains a list of version\nrequirements from the meson.build and not the actual version of\nthe dependency on disc. The version list is empty if no version was\nspecified in the meson.build.\n"});
