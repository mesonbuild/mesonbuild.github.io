VS does not seem to support adding entire source\ntrees at once, so you have to add sources to the solution manually.\nIn the main view go to Solution Explorer, right click on the project\nyou just created and select Add -> Existing Item, browse to your\nsource tree and select all files you want to have in this project. Now\nyou can use the editor and debugger as in a normal VS project.\n"});
