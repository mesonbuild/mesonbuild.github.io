Older versions are unaffected by this.\nMicrosoft's stated rationale is that \"a lot of existing code appears to depend\non the value of this macro matching 199711L\", therefore for compatibility with\nsuch (MSVC-only) code they will require opting in to the standards-conformant\nvalue.\nMeson now always sets the option if it is available, as it is unlikely that\nusers want the default behavior, and impossible to use the default behavior\nin cross-platform code (which frequently breaks as soon as the first person\ntries to compile using MSVC).\n"});
