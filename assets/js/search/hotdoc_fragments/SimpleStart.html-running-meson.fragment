On Windows you have to use the Visual\nStudio Developer Tools Command Prompt as discussed above, because the\ncompilers are only available in that terminal. You also need to change\ninto your home directory (Linux and macOS terminals start in the home\ndirectory by default).\nCreate a new directory to hold your project.\nUse Meson to create and build a new sample project.\nThis will create a project skeleton for you and compile it. The result\nis put in the build subdirectory and can be run directly from there.\n\nThe project is now ready for development. You can edit the code with\nany editor and it is rebuilt by going in the build subdirectory and\nexecuting the meson compile command. If your version of Meson is too\nold, you can compile the project by running the command ninja\ninstead.\n"});
