fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#project_default_options","fragment":"Accepts strings in the form key=value\nwhich have the same format as options to meson configure.\nFor example to set the default project type you would\nset this: default_options : ['buildtype=debugoptimized']. Note\nthat these settings are only used when running Meson for the first\ntime.\nNote that some options can override the default behavior;\nfor example, using c_args here means that the CFLAGS\nenvironment variable is not used. Consider using\n[add_project_arguments()] instead.\nAlso note that not all options are taken into account when\nbuilding as a subproject, and the exact set of options\nthat are per-subproject has increased over time; for more\ninformation, see core options\nand compiler options.\n(since 1.2.0): A dictionary may now be passed.\n"});
