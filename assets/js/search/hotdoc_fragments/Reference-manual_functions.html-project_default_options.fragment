fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#project_default_options","fragment":"Accepts strings in the form key=value\nwhich have the same format as options to meson configure.\nFor example to set the default project type you would\nset this: default_options : ['buildtype=debugoptimized']. Note\nthat these settings are only used when running Meson for the first\ntime. Global options such as buildtype can only be specified in\nthe master project, settings in subprojects are ignored. Project\nspecific options are used normally even in subprojects.\nNote that some options can override the default behavior;\nfor example, using c_args here means that the CFLAGS\nenvironment variable is not used. Consider using\n[add_project_arguments()] instead.\n(since 1.2.0): A dictionary may now be passed.\n"});
