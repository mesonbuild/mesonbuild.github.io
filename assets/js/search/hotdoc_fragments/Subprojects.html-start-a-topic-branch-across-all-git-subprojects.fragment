This is useful when starting local changes across\nmultiple subprojects. It is still your responsibility to commit and\npush in each repository where you made local changes.\nTo come back to the revision set in wrap file (i.e. master), just run\nmeson subprojects checkout with no branch name.\nSince 0.56.0 any pending changes are now stashed before checkout a new branch.\n"});
