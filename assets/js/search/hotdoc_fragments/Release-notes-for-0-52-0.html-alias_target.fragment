Like all top-level\ntargets, this integrates with the selected backend. For instance, with\nNinja you can run it as ninja target_name. This is a dummy target\nthat does not execute any command, but ensures that all dependencies\nare built. Dependencies can be any build target (e.g. return value of\nexecutable(), custom_target(), etc)\n"});
