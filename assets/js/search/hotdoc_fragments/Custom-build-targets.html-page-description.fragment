For these\ncases it permits you to define custom build targets. Here is how one\nwould use it.\nThis would generate the binary output.bin and install it to\n${prefix}/subdir/output.bin. Variable substitution works just like\nit does for source generation.\nSee Generating Sources for more information on this topic.\nMeson only permits you to specify one command to run. This is by\ndesign as writing shell pipelines into build definition files leads to\ncode that is very hard to maintain. If your compilation requires\nmultiple steps you need to write a wrapper script that does all the\nnecessary work. When doing this you need to be mindful of the\nfollowing issues:\n\ndo not assume that the command is invoked in any specific directory\na target called target file outfile defined in subdir subdir\nmust be written to build_dir/subdir/foo.dat\n\nif you need a subdirectory for temporary files, use\nbuild_dir/subdir/target.dir\n\n\n"});
