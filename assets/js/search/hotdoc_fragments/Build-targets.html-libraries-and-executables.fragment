fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Build-targets.html#libraries-and-executables","fragment":"Libraries and executables\nAs an example, here is how you would build a library.\nIt is generally preferred to use the library command instead of\nshared_library and static_library and then configure which\nlibraries (static or shared or both of them) will be built at the\nbuild configuration time using the default_library\nbuilt-in option.\nIn Unix-like operating systems, shared libraries can be\nversioned. Meson supports this with keyword arguments, which will be\nignored if the library is configured as static at the compile time.\nIt is common to build a library and then an executable that links\nagainst it. This is supported as well.\nMeson sets things up so that the resulting executable can be run\ndirectly from the build directory. There is no need to write shell\nscripts or set environment variables.\nOne target can have multiple language source files.\n"});
