fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Cross-compilation.html#properties","fragment":"Properties\nIn addition to the properties allowed in all machine\nfiles, the cross file may contain\nspecific information about the cross compiler or the host machine. It\nlooks like this:\nIn most cases you don't need the size and alignment settings, Meson\nwill detect all these by compiling and running some sample programs.\nIf your build requires some piece of data that is not listed here,\nMeson will stop and write an error message describing how to fix the\nissue. If you need extra compiler arguments to be used during cross\ncompilation you can set them with [langname]_args = [args]. Just\nremember to specify the args as an array and not as a single string\n(i.e. not as '-DCROSS=1 -DSOMETHING=3').\nSince 0.52.0 The sys_root property may point to the root of the\nhost system path (the system that will run the compiled binaries).\nThis is used internally by Meson to set the PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR\nenvironment variable for pkg-config. If this is unset the host system\nis assumed to share a root with the build system.\nSince 0.54.0 The pkg_config_libdir property may point to a list of\npath used internally by Meson to set the PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR environment\nvariable for pkg-config. This prevents pkg-config from searching cross\ndependencies in system directories.\nOne important thing to note, if you did not define an exe_wrapper in\nthe previous section, is that Meson will make a best-effort guess at\nwhether it can run the generated binaries on the build machine. It\ndetermines whether this is possible by looking at the system and\ncpu_family of build vs host. There will however be cases where they\ndo match up, but the build machine is actually not compatible with the\nhost machine. Typically this will happen if the libc used by the build\nand host machines are incompatible, or the code relies on kernel\nfeatures not available on the build machine. One concrete example is a\nmacOS build machine producing binaries for an iOS Simulator x86-64\nhost. They're both darwin and the same architecture, but their\nbinaries are not actually compatible. In such cases you may use the\nneeds_exe_wrapper property to override the auto-detection:\n"});
