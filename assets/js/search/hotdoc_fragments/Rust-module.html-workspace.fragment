If any of these\narguments is not specified, default_features is taken as true and\nfeatures as the empty list.\nOnce established, the Cargo interpreter's configuration is locked. Later calls to\nworkspace() must either omit all arguments (accepting the existing configuration)\nor provide the same set of features as the first call. Mismatched arguments will cause\na build error.\nThe recommendation is to not specify any keyword arguments in a subproject, so\nthat they simply inherit the parent's configuration.  Be careful about the\ndifference between specifying arguments and not doing so:\nThe first form says \"use whatever features are configured,\" while the latter forms\nsay \"require this specific configuration,\" which may conflict with the parent project.\n\n\ndefault_features: (bool, optional) Whether to enable default features.\n\nfeatures: (list[str], optional) List of additional features to enable globally.\n\n"});
