This will be\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS/meson/cross, or if XDG_DATA_DIRS is undefined, then\n/usr/local/share/meson/cross and /usr/share/meson/cross will be tried\nin that order, for system wide cross files. User local files can be\nput in $XDG_DATA_HOME/meson/cross, or ~/.local/share/meson/cross if\nthat is undefined.\nThe order of locations tried is as follows:\nDistributions are encouraged to ship cross files either with their\ncross compiler toolchain packages or as a standalone package, and put\nthem in one of the system paths referenced above.\nThese files can be loaded automatically without adding a path to the\ncross file. For example, if a ~/.local/share/meson/cross contains a\nfile called x86-linux, then the following command would start a cross\nbuild using that cross files:\n\nA file relative to the local dir\nThe user local location\nThe system wide locations in order\n\n"});
