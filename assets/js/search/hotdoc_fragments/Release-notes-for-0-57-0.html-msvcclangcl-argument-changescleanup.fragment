The arguments removed are /Ob0, /Od, /RTC1. (/Zi was also removed, but it is already added by default when debug is enabled.)\nIf these are important issues for you and would like builtin toggle options,\nplease file an issue in the Meson bug tracker.\n\n\"Disable Debug\" (/Od) is no longer manually specified for optimization levels {0,g} (it is already the default for MSVC).\n\"Run Time Checking\" (/RTC1) removed from debug buildtype by default\nClang-CL debug buildtype arguments now match MSVC arguments\nThere is now no difference between buildtype flags and debug + optimization flags\n\n"});
