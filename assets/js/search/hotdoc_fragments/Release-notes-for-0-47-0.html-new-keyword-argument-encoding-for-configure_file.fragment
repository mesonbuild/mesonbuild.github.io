The\ndefault value is the same as before: UTF-8.\nIn the past, Meson would not handle non-UTF-8/ASCII files correctly,\nand in the worst case would try to coerce it to UTF-8 and mangle the\ndata. UTF-8 is the standard encoding now, but sometimes it is\nnecessary to process files that use a different encoding.\nFor additional details see #3135.\n"});
