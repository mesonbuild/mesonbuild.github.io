The tool is designed to be run in the build directory. \nThe simplest thing to do is just to run all tests which is equivalent to running ninja test. \nYou can also run only a single test by giving its name \nTests belonging to a suite suite can be run as follows \nSince version sub project_name can be omitted if it is the top level project. \nSometimes you need to run the tests multiple times which is done like this \nInvoking tests via a helper executable such as Valgrind can be done with the wrap argument \nArguments to the wrapper binary can be given like this \nMeson also supports running the tests under GDB. Just doing this \nMeson will launch gdb all set up to run the test. Just type run in the GDB command prompt to start the program. \nThe second use case is a test that segfaults only rarely. In this case you can invoke the following command \nThis runs the test up to times under GDB automatically. If the program crashes GDB will halt and the user can debug the application. Note that testing timeouts are disabled in this case so meson test will not kill gdb while the developer is still debugging it. The downside is that if the test binary freezes the test runner will wait forever. \nFor further information see the command line help of Meson by running meson test h. \nNOTE If meson test does not work for you you likely have a old version of Meson. In that case you should call mesontest instead. If mesontest doesn t work either you have a very old version prior to and should upgrade. \n"});
