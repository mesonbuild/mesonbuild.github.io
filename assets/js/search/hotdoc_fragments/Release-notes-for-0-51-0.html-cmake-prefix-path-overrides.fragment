Now cmake can do the same, as long as\nthe dependency uses a ${Name}Config.cmake file (not a\nFind{$Name}.cmake file), by passing\n-Dcmake_prefix_path=list,of,paths. It is important that point this\nat the prefix that the dependency is installed into, not the cmake\npath.\nIf you have installed something to /tmp/dep, which has a layout like:\nthen invoke Meson as meson setup builddir/ -Dcmake_prefix_path=/tmp/dep\n"});
