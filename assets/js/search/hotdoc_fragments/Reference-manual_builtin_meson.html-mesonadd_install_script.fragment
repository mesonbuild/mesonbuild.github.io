fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_builtin_meson.html#mesonadd_install_script","fragment":"meson.add_install_script()\nCauses the script given as an argument to be run during the install step,\nthis script  will have the environment variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT,\nMESON_BUILD_ROOT, MESON_INSTALL_PREFIX,\nMESON_INSTALL_DESTDIR_PREFIX, and MESONINTROSPECT set.\nAll positional arguments are passed as parameters.\n(since 0.54.0) If meson install is called with the --quiet option, the\nenvironment variable MESON_INSTALL_QUIET will be set.\nMeson uses the DESTDIR environment variable as set by the\ninherited environment to determine the (temporary) installation\nlocation for files. Your install script must be aware of this while\nmanipulating and installing files. The correct way to handle this is\nwith the MESON_INSTALL_DESTDIR_PREFIX variable which is always set\nand contains DESTDIR (if set) and prefix joined together. This\nis useful because both are usually absolute paths and there are\nplatform-specific edge-cases in joining two absolute paths.\nIn case it is needed, MESON_INSTALL_PREFIX is also always set and\nhas the value of the prefix option passed to Meson.\nMESONINTROSPECT contains the path to the introspect command that\ncorresponds to the meson executable that was used to configure the\nbuild. (This might be a different path than the first executable\nfound in PATH.) It can be used to query build configuration. Note\nthat the value will contain many parts, f.ex., it may be python3 /path/to/meson.py introspect. The user is responsible for splitting\nthe string to an array if needed by splitting lexically like a UNIX\nshell would. If your script uses Python, shlex.split() is the\neasiest correct way to do this.\n\n\n"});
