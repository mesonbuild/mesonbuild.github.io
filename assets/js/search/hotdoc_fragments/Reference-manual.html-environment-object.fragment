It should be passed as the env keyword argument to\ntests and other functions. It has the following methods.\nappend(varname, value1, value2, ...): appends the given values to\nthe old value of the environment variable, e.g.  env.append('FOO', 'BAR', 'BAZ', separator : ';') produces BOB;BAR;BAZ if FOO had\nthe value BOB and plain BAR;BAZ if the value was not defined. If\nthe separator is not specified explicitly, the default path\nseparator for the host operating system will be used, i.e. ';' for\nWindows and ':' for UNIX/POSIX systems.\nprepend(varname, value1, value2, ...): same as append\nexcept that it writes to the beginning of the variable.\nset(varname, value1, value2): sets the environment variable\nspecified in the first argument to the values in the second argument\njoined by the separator, e.g.  env.set('FOO', 'BAR'), sets envvar\nFOO to value BAR. See append() above for how separators work.\nSince 0.58.0 append() and prepend() methods can be called multiple times\non the same varname. Earlier Meson versions would warn and only the last\noperation took effect.\n\n\nappend(varname, value1, value2, ...): appends the given values to\nthe old value of the environment variable, e.g.  env.append('FOO', 'BAR', 'BAZ', separator : ';') produces BOB;BAR;BAZ if FOO had\nthe value BOB and plain BAR;BAZ if the value was not defined.
