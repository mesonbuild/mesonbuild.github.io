fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Wrap-dependency-system-manual.html#how-it-works","fragment":"How it works\nMeson has a concept of subprojects. They are a way\nof nesting one Meson project inside another. Any project that builds\nwith Meson can detect that it is built as a subproject and build\nitself in a way that makes it easy to use (usually this means as a\nstatic library).\nTo use this kind of a project as a dependency you could just copy and\nextract it inside your project's subprojects directory.\nHowever there is a simpler way. You can specify a Wrap file that tells\nMeson how to download it for you. If you then use this subproject in\nyour build, Meson will automatically download and extract it during\nbuild. This makes subproject embedding extremely easy.\nAll wrap files must have a name of <project_name>.wrap form and be\nin subprojects dir.\nCurrently Meson has four kinds of wraps:\n\nwrap-file\nwrap-git\nwrap-hg\nwrap-svn\n\n"});
