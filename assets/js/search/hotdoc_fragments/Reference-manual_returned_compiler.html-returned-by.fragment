Hence, you can\ntrust that the tests will be fully self-contained, and won't fail\nbecause of custom flags added by other parts of the build file or by\nusers.\nNote that if you have a single prefix with all your dependencies, you\nmight find it easier to append to the environment variables\nC_INCLUDE_PATH with GCC/Clang and INCLUDE with MSVC to expand the\ndefault include path, and LIBRARY_PATH with GCC/Clang and LIB with\nMSVC to expand the default library search path.\nHowever, with GCC, these variables will be ignored when\ncross-compiling. In that case you need to use a specs file. See:\nhttp://www.mingw.org/wiki/SpecsFileHOWTO\n\nmeson.get_compiler()\n\n"});
