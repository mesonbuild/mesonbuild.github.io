By reliable we mean that\nif the user adds a new source file to the subdirectory, Meson should\ndetect that and make it part of the build automatically.\nOne of the main requirements of Meson is that it must be fast. This\nmeans that a no-op build in a tree of 10 000 source files must take no\nmore than a fraction of a second. This is only possible because Meson\nknows the exact list of files to check. If any target is specified as\na wildcard glob, this is no longer possible. Meson would need to\nre-evaluate the glob every time and compare the list of files produced\nagainst the previous list. This means inspecting the entire source\ntree (because the glob pattern could be src/\\*/\\*/\\*/\\*.cpp or\nsomething like that). This is impossible to do efficiently.\nThe main backend of Meson is Ninja, which does not support wildcard\nmatches either, and for the same reasons.\nBecause of this, all source files must be specified explicitly.\n"});
