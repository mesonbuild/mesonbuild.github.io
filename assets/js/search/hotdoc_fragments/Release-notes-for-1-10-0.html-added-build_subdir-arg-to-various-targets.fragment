This directs Meson to place the build\nresult within the specified sub-directory path of the build directory.\nThis places the build result, config.h, in a sub-directory named\nconfig-subdir, creating it if necessary. To prevent collisions\nwithin the build directory, build_subdir is not allowed to match a\nfile or directory in the source directory nor contain '..' to refer to\nthe parent of the build directory. build_subdir does not affect the\ninstall directory path at all; config.h will be installed as\nshare/appdir/config.h. build_subdir may contain multiple levels of\ndirectory names.\nThis allows construction of files within the build system that have\nany required trailing path name components as well as building\nmultiple files with the same basename from the same source directory.\n"});
