Thus\nthey should have the same name as the upstream projects.\nNOTE: Wrap names must fully match this regexp: [a-z0-9._]+.\nIf the project provides a pkg-config file, then the wrap name\nshould be the same as the pkg-config name. Usually this is the name of\nthe project, such as libpng. Sometimes it is slightly different,\nhowever. As an example the libogg project's chosen pkg-config name is\nogg instead of libogg, which is the reason why the wrap is\nnamed plain ogg.\nIf there is no pkg-config file, the name the project uses/promotes\nshould be used, lowercase only (Catch2 -> catch2).\nIf the project name is too generic or ambiguous (e.g. benchmark),\nconsider using organization-project naming format (e.g.\ngoogle-benchmark).\n"});
