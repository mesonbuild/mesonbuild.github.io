When this is used, deprecated features\nfrom before that version produce warnings, as do features which aren't\navailable in all supported versions.\nWhen no minimum version was specified, meson didn't warn you even about\ndeprecated functionality that might go away in an upcoming semver major release\nof meson.\nNow, meson will treat an unspecified minimum version following semver:\nFor new features introduced in the current meson semver major cycle\n(currently: all features added since 1.0) a warning is printed. Features that\nhave been available since the initial 1.0 release are assumed to be widely\navailable.\nFor features that have been deprecated by any version of meson, a warning is\nprinted. Since no minimum version was specified, it is assumed that the\nproject wishes to follow the latest and greatest functionality.\nThese warnings will overlap for functionality that was both deprecated and\nreplaced with an alternative in the current release cycle. The combination\nmeans that projects without a minimum version specified are assumed to want\nbroad compatibility with the current release cycle (1.x).\nProjects that specify a minimum meson_version: will continue to only receive\nactionable warnings based on their current minimum version.\n\n\nFor new features introduced in the current meson semver major cycle\n(currently: all features added since 1.0) a warning is printed.
