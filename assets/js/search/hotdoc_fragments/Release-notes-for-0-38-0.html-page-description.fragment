fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Release-notes-for-0-38-0.html#page-description","fragment":"Meson allows you to uninstall an install step by invoking the\nuninstall target. This will remove all files installed as part of\ninstall. Note that this does not restore the original files. This also\ndoes not undo changes done by custom install scripts (because they can\ndo arbitrary install operations).\nSometimes you need to run unit tests with special settings. For\nexample under Valgrind. Usually this requires extra command line\noptions for the tool. This is supported with the new test setup\nfeature. For example to set up a test run with Valgrind, you'd write\nthis in a meson.build file:\nThis tells Meson to run tests with Valgrind using the given options\nand multiplying the test timeout values by 100. To run this test setup\nsimply issue the following command:\nAs usual, just set CC=icc CXX=icpc and Meson will use it as the\nC/C++ compiler. Currently only Linux is supported.\nNow it is possible to query values stored in configuration data\nobjects.\nBuilding Python 3 extension modules has always been possible, but it\nis now even easier:\nProjects can specify overriding values for subprojects'\ndefault_options when invoking a subproject:\nThe effect is the same as if the default options were written in the\nsubproject's project call.\nBuild targets got a new keyword build_by_default which tells whether\nthe target should be built by default when running e.g. ninja.\nCustom targets are not built by default but other targets are. Any\ntarget that is tagged as installed or to be built always is also built\nby default, regardless of the value of this keyword.\nMeson caches the results of dependency lookups. Sometimes these may\nget out of sync with the system state. Mesonconf now has a\n--clearcache option to clear these values so they will be\nre-searched from the system upon next compile.\nThe new install_mode keyword argument can be used to specify file\npermissions and uid/gid of files when doing the install. This allows\nyou to, for example, install suid root scripts.\nWhen using compilers that implement the __has_include()\npreprocessor\nmacro,\nthe check is now ~40% faster.\nThe second argument to the array\n.get() function is now returned\nif the specified index could not be found\nThe Meson test executor got a new argument -q (and --quiet) that\nsuppresses all output of successful tests. This makes interactive\nusage nicer because only errors are printed.\n"});
