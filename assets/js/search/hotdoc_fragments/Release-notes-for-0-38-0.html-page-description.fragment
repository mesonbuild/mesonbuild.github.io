For example under Valgrind. Usually this requires extra command line options for the tool. This is supported with the new test setup feature. For example to set up a test run with Valgrind you d write this in a meson.build file \nThis tells Meson to run tests with Valgrind using the given options and multiplying the test timeout values by To run this test setup simply issue the following command \nNow it is possible to query values stored in configuration data objects. \nProjects can specify overriding values for subprojects default_options when invoking a subproject \nThe effect is the same as if the default options were written in the subproject s project call. \nBuild targets got a new keyword build_by_default which tells whether the target should be built by default when running e.g. ninja. Custom targets are not built by default but other targets are. Any target that is tagged as installed or to be built always is also built by default regardless of the value of this keyword. \nMeson caches the results of dependency lookups. Sometimes these may get out of sync with the system state. Mesonconf now has a clearcache option to clear these values so they will be re searched from the system upon next compile. \nThe new install_mode keyword argument can be used to specify file permissions and uid gid of files when doing the install. This allows you to for example install suid root scripts. \nWhen using compilers that implement the __has_include preprocessor macro the check is now faster. \nThe second argument to the array get function is now returned if the specified index could not be found \n"});
