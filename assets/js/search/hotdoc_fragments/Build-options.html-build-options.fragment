As an example a\nprogram may have two different data backends that are selectable at\nbuild time. Meson provides for this by having a option definition\nfile. Its name is meson.options and it is placed at the root of\nyour source tree. For versions of meson before 1.1, this file was called\nmeson_options.txt.\nHere is a simple option file.\nFor built-in options, see Built-in options.\n"});
