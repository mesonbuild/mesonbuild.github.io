In this case we can use Wine, which\nruns Windows applications on Linux. Other choices include running the\napplication with qemu or a hardware simulator. If you have this kind\nof a wrapper, these lines are all you need to write. Meson will\nautomatically use the given wrapper when it needs to run host\nbinaries. This happens e.g. when running the project's test suite.\nNote that exe_wrapper in the cross file is handled separately\nfrom the exe_wrapper argument in\nadd_test_setup\nand meson test --wrapper\ncommand line argument. Meson must have exe_wrapper specified in the\ncross file or else it will skip tests that attempt to run cross\ncompiled binaries.
