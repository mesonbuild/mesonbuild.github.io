fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reproducible-builds.html#reproducible-builds","fragment":"Reproducible builds\nA reproducible build means the following (as quoted from the\nreproducible builds project site):\nReproducible builds are a set of software development practices that\ncreate a verifiable path from human readable source code to the\nbinary code used by computers.\nRoughly what this means is that if two different people compile the\nproject from source, their outputs are bitwise identical to each\nother. This allows people to verify that binaries downloadable from\nthe net actually come from the corresponding sources and have not, for\nexample, had malware added to them.\nMeson aims to support reproducible builds out of the box with zero\nadditional work (assuming the rest of the build environment is set up\nfor reproducibility). If you ever find a case where this is not\nhappening, it is a bug. Please file an issue with as much information\nas possible and we'll get it fixed.\n"});
