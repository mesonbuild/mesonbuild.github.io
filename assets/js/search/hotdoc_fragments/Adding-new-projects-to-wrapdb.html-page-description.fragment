It is initialized like this \nNote that this is the only commit that will ever be made to master branch. All other commits are done to branches. \nRepo names must fully match this regexp a z0 _ \nCreate a new branch whose name matches the upstream release number. \nBranch names must fully match this regexp a z0 _ \nHere is where the magic happens. Whenever a new commit is pushed into GitHub s project branch a new wrap is generated with an incremented version number. All the old releases remain unaltered. New commits are always done via GitHub merge requests and must be reviewed by someone other than the submitter. \nNote that your Git repo must not contain the subdirectory of the source release. That gets added automatically by the service. You also must not commit any source code from the original tarball into the wrap repository. \nFirst you need to fork the repository to your own page. Then you can create the first Wrap commit that usually looks something like this. \nNow you can file a merge request. Remember to file it against branch rather than master. GitHub should do this automatically. \n"});
