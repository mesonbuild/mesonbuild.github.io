Meson will automatically create the matching pch implementation\nfile for you.\nBefore version 0.50.0, in addition to the header file, Meson\nalso requires a corresponding source file. If your header is called\nfoo_pch.h, the corresponding source file is usually called\nfoo_pch.cpp and it resides in the same pch subdirectory as the\nheader. Its contents are this:\nTo enable pch, simply list both files in the target definition:\nThis form will work with both GCC and msvc, because Meson knows that\nGCC does not need a .cpp file and thus just ignores it.\nIt should be noted that due to implementation details of the MSVC\ncompiler, having precompiled headers for multiple languages in the\nsame target is not guaranteed to work.\n"});
