fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "meson object \nThe meson object allows you to introspect various properties of the system. This object is always mapped in the meson variable. It has the following methods. \nadd_install_script script_name arg1 arg2 causes the script given as an argument to be run during the install step this script will have the environment variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT MESON_BUILD_ROOT MESON_INSTALL_PREFIX MESON_INSTALL_DESTDIR_PREFIX and MESONINTROSPECT set. All additional arguments are passed as parameters. \nadd_postconf_script script_name arg1 arg2 will run the executable given as an argument after all project files have been generated. This script will have the environment variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT and MESON_BUILD_ROOT set. \nbackend added returns a string representing the current backend ninja vs2010 vs2015 vs2017 or xcode. \nbuild_root returns a string with the absolute path to the build root directory. \ncurrent_build_dir returns a string with the absolute path to the current build directory. \ncurrent_source_dir returns a string to the current source directory. Note you do not need to use this function when passing files from the current source directory to a function since that is the default. Also you can use the files function to refer to files in the current or any other source directory instead of constructing paths manually with meson.current_source_dir \nget_cross_property propname fallback_value returns the given property from a cross file the optional second argument is returned if not cross compiling or the given property is not found. \nget_compiler language returns an object describing a compiler takes one positional argument which is the language to use. It also accepts one keyword argument native which when set to true makes Meson return the compiler for the build machine the native compiler and when false it returns the host compiler the cross compiler If native is omitted Meson returns the cross compiler if we re currently cross compiling and the native compiler if we re not. \nhas_exe_wrapper returns true when doing a cross build if there is a wrapper command that can be used to execute cross built binaries for example when cross compiling from Linux to Windows one can use wine as the wrapper \ninstall_dependency_manifest output_name installs a manifest file containing a list of all subprojects their versions and license files to the file name given as the argument. \nis_cross_build returns true if the current build is a cross build and false otherwise. \nis_subproject returns true if the current project is being built as a subproject of some other project and false otherwise. \nis_unity returns true when doing a unity build multiple sources are combined before compilation to reduce build time and false otherwise. \nTo determine the installation location the script should use the DESTDIR MESON_INSTALL_PREFIX MESON_INSTALL_DESTDIR_PREFIX variables. DESTDIR will be set only if it is inherited from the outside environment. MESON_INSTALL_PREFIX is always set and has the value of the prefix option passed to Meson. MESON_INSTALL_DESTDIR_PREFIX is always set and contains DESTDIR and prefix joined together. This is useful because both are absolute paths and many path joining functions such as os.path.join in Python special case absolute paths. \nMESONINTROSPECT contains the path to the introspect command that corresponds to the meson executable that was used to configure the build. This might be a different path then the first executable found in PATH. It can be used to query build configuration. Note that the value may contain many parts i.e. it may be python3 path to meson.py introspect. The user is responsible for splitting the string to an array if needed. \nsource_root returns a string with the absolute path to the source root directory. Note you should use the files function to refer to files in the root source directory instead of constructing paths manually with meson.source_root \nproject_version returns the version string specified in project function call. \nproject_name returns the project name specified in the project function call. \nversion return a string with the version of Meson. \n", "url": "Reference-manual.html#meson-object"});
