The JSON format for one target is defined as follows:\nIf the key installed is set to true, the key install_filename\nwill also be present. It stores the installation location for each\nfile in filename. If one file in filename is not installed, its\ncorresponding install location is set to null.\nThe subproject key specifies the name of the subproject this target\nwas defined in, or null if the target was defined in the top level\nproject.\n(New in 0.56.0) The extra_files key lists all files specified via\nthe extra_files kwarg of a build target. See\nexecutable().\nA target usually generates only one file. However, it is possible for\ncustom targets to have multiple outputs.\n"});
