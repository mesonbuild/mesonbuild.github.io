fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Subprojects and dependencies \nA common use case is to use subprojects to provide dependencies on platforms that do not provide them out of the box. This is especially common on Windows. Meson makes this easy while at the same time using system dependencies if are available. The way to do this is to set up a subproject that builds the dependency and has an internal dependency declared like this \nThen you can use the subproject in the master project like this \nThis uses the system dependency when available and the self built version if not. If you want to always use the subproject that is also possible just use subproject and get_variable as discussed above to get the dependency object. \n", "url": "Subprojects.html#subprojects-and-dependencies"});
