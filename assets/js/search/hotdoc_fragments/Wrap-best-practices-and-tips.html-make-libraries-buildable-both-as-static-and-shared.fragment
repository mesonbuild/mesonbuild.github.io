In other cases you might want shared libraries. They are\nalso faster during development due to Meson's relinking optimization.\nHowever building both library types on all builds is slow and\nwasteful.\nYour project should use the library method that can be toggled\nbetween shared and static with the default_library builtin option.\n"});
