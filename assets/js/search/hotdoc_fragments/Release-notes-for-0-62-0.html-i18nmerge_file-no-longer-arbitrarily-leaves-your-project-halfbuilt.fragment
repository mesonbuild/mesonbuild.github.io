Due to\nimplementation details, this also disabled important data files created via\nmerge_file, leading to important desktop files etc. not being installed.\nThis overreaction has been fixed. It is no longer possible to have NLS-disabled\nbuilds which break the project by not installing important files which have\nnothing to do with NLS (other than including some).\nIf you were depending on not having the Gettext tools installed and\nsuccessfully mis-building your project, you may need to make your project\nactually work with NLS disabled, for example by providing some version of your\nfiles which is still installed even when merge_file cannot be run.\n"});
