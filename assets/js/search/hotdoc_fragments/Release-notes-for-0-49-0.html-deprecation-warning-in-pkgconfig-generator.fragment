fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Release-notes-for-0-49-0.html#deprecation-warning-in-pkgconfig-generator","fragment":"Deprecation warning in pkg-config generator\nAll libraries passed to the libraries keyword argument of the\ngenerate() method used to be associated with that generated\npkg-config file. That means that any subsequent call to generate()\nwhere those libraries appear would add the filebase of the\ngenerate() that first contained them into Requires: or\nRequires.private: field instead of adding an -l to Libs: or\nLibs.private:.\nThis behaviour is now deprecated. The library that should be\nassociated with the generated pkg-config file should be passed as\nfirst positional argument instead of in the libraries keyword\nargument. The previous behaviour is maintained but prints a\ndeprecation warning and support for this will be removed in a future\nMeson release. If you cannot create the needed pkg-config file\nwithout this warning, please file an issue with as much details as\npossible about the situation.\nFor example this sample will write Requires: liba into libb.pc but\nprint a deprecation warning:\nIt can be fixed by passing liba as first positional argument::\n"});
