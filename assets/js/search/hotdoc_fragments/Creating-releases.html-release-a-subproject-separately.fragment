fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Creating-releases.html#release-a-subproject-separately","fragment":"Release a subproject separately\nSince 0.57.0 the meson dist command can now create a distribution tarball\nfor a subproject in the same git repository as the main project. This can be\nuseful if parts of the project (e.g. libraries) can be built and distributed\nseparately. In that case they can be moved into subprojects/mysub and running\nmeson dist in that directory will now create a tarball containing only the\nsource code from that subdir and not the rest of the main project or other\nsubprojects.\nFor example:\nThis produces builddir/meson-dist/mysubproject-1.0.tar.xz tarball.\n"});
