fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Shipping-prebuilt-binaries-as-wraps.html#note-for-linux-libraries","fragment":"Note for Linux libraries\nA precompiled linux shared library (.so) requires a soname field to be properly installed. If the soname field is missing, binaries referencing the library will require a hard link to the location of the library at install time (/path/to/your/project/subprojects/precompiledlibrary/lib.so instead of $INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/lib.so) after installation.\nYou should change the compilation options for the precompiled library to avoid this issue. If recompiling is not an option, you can use the patchelf tool with the command patchelf --set-soname libfoo.so libfoo.so to edit the precompiled library after the fact.\nMeson generally guarantees any library it compiles has a soname. One notable exception is libraries built with the shared_module() function.\n"});
