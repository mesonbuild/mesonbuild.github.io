fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"fallback-wraptool.html#page-description","fragment":"In case wraptool is down we have created a backup script that you can\nuse to download wraps directly from the GitHub repos. It is not as\nslick and may have bugs but at least it will allow you to use wraps.\nTo list all available wraps:\nTo install a wrap, go to your source root, make sure that the\nsubprojects directory exists and run this command:\nThis will stage the subproject ready to use. If you have multiple\nsubprojects you need to download them all manually.\nSpecifying branch name is optional. If not specified, the list of\npotential branches is sorted alphabetically and the last branch is\nused.\nNote The tool was added in 0.32.0, for versions older than that you\nneed to delete the foo.wrap file to work around this issue.\nNuke the contents of subprojects and start again.\nSome repositories show up in the list but are not installable. They\nwould not show up in the real WrapDB because they are works in\nprogress.\nGitHub web API limits the amount of queries you can do to 60/hour. If\nyou exceed that you need to wait for the timer to reset.\n"});
