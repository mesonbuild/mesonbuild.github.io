This\nrelease series is now End-of-Life (EOL). The only LTS distribution\nthat still only ships Python 3.5 is Ubuntu 16.04, which will be EOL\nin April 2021.\nPython 3.6 has numerous features that we find useful such as improved\nsupport for the typing module, f-string support, and better\nintegration with the pathlib module.\nAs a result, we will begin requiring Python 3.6 or newer in Meson\n0.57, which is the next release. Starting with Meson 0.56, we now\nprint a NOTICE: when a meson command is run on Python 3.5 to\ninform users about this. This notice has also been backported into the\n0.55.2 stable release.\n"});
