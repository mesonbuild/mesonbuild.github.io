fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Getting-meson.html#installing-meson-with-pip","fragment":"Installing Meson with pip\nMeson is available in the Python Package Index and can be installed\nwith sudo pip3 install meson which requires root and will install it\nsystem-wide.\nIf you have downloaded a copy of the Meson sources already, you can\ninstall it with sudo pip3 install path/to/source/root/.\nAlternatively, you can use pip3 install --user meson which will\ninstall it for your user and does not require any special\nprivileges. This will install the package in ~/.local/, so you will\nhave to add ~/.local/bin to your PATH, and sudo meson install\nwill be completely broken since the program will not be available to\nroot. Only use a user copy of Meson if you do not care about\ninstalling projects as root.\n"});
