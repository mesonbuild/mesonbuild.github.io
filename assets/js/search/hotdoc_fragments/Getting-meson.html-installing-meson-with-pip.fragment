This does not require any special\nprivileges. This will install the package in ~/.local/, so you will\nhave to add ~/.local/bin to your PATH. If you are using Meson only\nfor local development this should be all you need.\nIf you need to install your project in system directories, this\napproach will not work as executable installed in this way are not\navailable when sudo is used. You can install Meson so it can be used\nby every user with sudo pip3 install meson. It is generally not\nrecommended to do this, but instead use the version provided by distro\npackages.\nIf you must install Meson with sudo pip3 make sure to uninstall any\ndistro version first. Having multiple versions of any program in\nsystem directories can lead to problems.\n"});
