At the same time the\nmodules semantics for the dependency has been changed. Previously it\nwas allowed to specify header directories as modules but it wasn't\nrequired. Now, modules are only used to specify libraries that require\nlinking.\nThis is a breaking change and the fix is to remove all modules that aren't\nfound.\n"});
