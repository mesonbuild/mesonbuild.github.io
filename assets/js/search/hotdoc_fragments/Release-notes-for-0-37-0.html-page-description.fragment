As an example you can run tests multiple times:\nor with an arbitrary wrapper executable:\nor under gdb, 1000 times in a row. This is handy for tests that fail\nspuriously, as when the crash happens you are given the full GDB\ncommand line:\nMesonrewriter is an experimental tool to manipulate your build\ndefinitions programmatically. It is not installed by default yet but\nthose interested can run it from the source repository.\nAs an example, here is how you would add a source file to a build target:\nThe new shared_module function allows the creation of shared\nmodules, that is, extension modules such as plugins that are meant to\nbe used solely with dlopen rather than linking them to targets.\nMeson has long had support for compiling assembler (GAS) files. In\nthis release we add support for compiling LLVM IR files in a similar\nway when building with the Clang compiler. Just add it to the list of\nfiles when creating a library or executable target like any other\nsource file. No special handling is required:\nAs always, you can also mix LLVM IR files with C++, C, and Assembly\n(GAS) sources.\nWe now include filetype, indent, and syntax files for ViM with the\nsource\ntree.\nPlease file issues (or pull requests!) for enhancements or if you face\nany problems using them.\n.wrap files for subprojects can now include a\nseparate push URL to allow developers to push changes directly from a\nsubproject git checkout.\nMeson now supports multiple version restrictions while searching for pkg-config dependencies.\nYou can now specify the binary to be used for the following tools by\nsetting the corresponding environment variable\nSimilar to other options such as bindir and datadir, you can now\nspecify the localstatedir for a project by passing\n--localstatedir=dir to meson or -Dlocalstatedir=dir to\nmesonconf after configuration. You can also access it from inside\nthe meson.build file with get_option('localstatedir').\nChecks if the compiler prefixes an underscore to C global symbols with\nthe default calling convention. This is useful when linking to\ncompiled assembly code, or other code that does not have its C symbol\nmangling handled transparently by the compiler.\nC symbol mangling is platform and architecture dependent, and a helper\nfunction is needed to detect it. For example, Windows 32-bit prefixes\nunderscore, but 64-bit does not. Linux does not prefix an underscore\nbut OS X does.\nGLib Resources compiled with\ngnome.compile_resources that\nare added to the sources of a Vala build target will now cause the\nappropriate --gresources flag to be passed to the Vala compiler so\nyou don't need to add that yourself to vala_args:.\nYou can now pass arguments to install scripts added with\nmeson.add_install_script(). All\narguments after the script name will be passed to the script.\nThe MESON_INSTALL_DESTDIR_PREFIX environment variable is now set\nwhen install scripts are called. This contains the values of the\nDESTDIR environment variable and the prefix option passed to Meson\njoined together. This is useful because both those are usually\nabsolute paths, and joining absolute paths in a cross-platform way is\ntricky. os.path.join in\nPython\nwill discard all previous path segments when it encounters an absolute\npath, and simply concatenating them will not work on Windows where\nabsolute paths begin with the drive letter.\nAdded new options sbindir and infodir that can be used for\ninstallation.\n\nDetect required programs and print useful errors if missing\n\n\nAllow passing a list of directories to src_dir keyword argument\nAdd namespace keyword argument\nAdd mode keyword argument\nFix gtkdoc-scangobj finding local libraries\n\n\nAdd gresource_bundle keyword argument to output .gresource files\nAdd export and install_header keyword arguments\nUse depfile support available in GLib >= 2.52.0\n\n\nAdd merge_file() function for creating translated files\nAdd preset keyword argument to included common gettext flags\nRead languages from LINGUAS file\n\n\n\n\n Name\n Environment variable\n\n\n\n\n pkg-config\n PKG_CONFIG\n\n\n readelf\n READELF\n\n\n nm\n NM\n\n\n\n"});
