Meson supports this use case natively. The commands needed to\nbuild and install Meson projects are the following.\nThe command line switch --buildtype=plain tells Meson not to add its\nown flags to the command line. This gives the packager total control\non used flags.\nThis is very similar to other build systems. The only difference is\nthat the DESTDIR variable is passed as an environment variable\nrather than as an argument to meson install.\nAs distro builds happen always from scratch, you might consider\nenabling unity builds on your packages because they\nare faster and produce better code. However there are many projects\nthat do not build with unity builds enabled so the decision to use\nunity builds must be done by the packager on a case by case basis.\n"});
