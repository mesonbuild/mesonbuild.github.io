fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"IDE-integration.html#target-sources","fragment":"Target sources\nThe intro-targets.json file also stores a list of all source objects\nof the target in the target_sources. With this information, an IDE\ncan provide code completion for all source files.\n(New in 1.7.0) The machine and language keys make it possible to\nto access further information about the compiler in the compilers\nintrospection information.  machine can be absent if language is\nunknown.  In this case, information about the compiler is not\navailable; Meson is therefore unable to know if the output relates\nto either the build of the host machine.\nIt should be noted that the compiler parameters stored in the\nparameters differ from the actual parameters used to compile the\nfile. This is because the parameters are optimized for the usage in an\nIDE to provide autocompletion support, etc. It is thus not recommended\nto use this introspection information for actual compilation.\n"});
