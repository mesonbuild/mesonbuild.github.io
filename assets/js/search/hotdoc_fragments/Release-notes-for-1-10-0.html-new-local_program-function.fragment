Meson will not look for the program in the\nsystem or in a subproject.\nIn addition, depends keyword argument can be specified in case the program\ndepends on built targets, for example a Python script could require a compiled\nC module. If any such dependency is present, the program can only be used in\nbuild-time commands (e.g. custom_target()).\nThe program can be passed to meson.override_find_program() and used in\nsubprojects.\n"});
