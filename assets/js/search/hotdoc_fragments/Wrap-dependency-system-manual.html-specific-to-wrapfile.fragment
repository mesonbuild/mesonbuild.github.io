fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Wrap-dependency-system-manual.html#specific-to-wrapfile","fragment":"Specific to wrap-file\nSince 0.55.0 it is possible to use only the source_filename and\npatch_filename value in a .wrap file (without source_url and\npatch_url) to specify a local archive in the\nsubprojects/packagefiles directory. The *_hash entries are\noptional when using this method. This method should be preferred over\nthe old packagecache approach described below.\nSince 0.49.0 if source_filename or patch_filename is found in the\nproject's subprojects/packagecache directory, it will be used instead\nof downloading the file, even if --wrap-mode option is set to\nnodownload. The file's hash will be checked.\n\n\nsource_url - download url to retrieve the wrap-file source archive\n\nsource_fallback_url - fallback URL to be used when download from source_url fails Since: 0.55.0\n\n\nsource_filename - filename of the downloaded source archive\n\nsource_hash - sha256 checksum of the downloaded source archive\n\nlead_directory_missing - for wrap-file create the leading\ndirectory name. Needed when the source file does not have a leading\ndirectory.\n\n"});
