To use Boost headers only libraries simply add Boost as a dependency. \nTo link against boost with Meson simply list which libraries you would like to use. \nYou can call dependency multiple times with different modules and use those to link against your targets. \nIf your boost headers or libraries are in non standard locations you can set the BOOST_ROOT BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and or BOOST_LIBRARYDIR environment variables. \nYou can set the argument threading to single to use boost libraries that has been compiled for single threaded use instead. \n"});
