fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Dependencies.html#boost","fragment":"Boost\nBoost is not a single dependency but rather a group of different\nlibraries. To use Boost headers-only libraries, simply add Boost as a\ndependency.\nTo link against boost with Meson, simply list which libraries you\nwould like to use.\nYou can call dependency() multiple times with different modules and\nuse those to link against your targets.\nIf your boost headers or libraries are in non-standard locations you\ncan set the BOOST_ROOT, or the BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and\nBOOST_LIBRARYDIR environment variables. (added in 0.56.0) You can\nalso set these parameters as boost_root, boost_include, and\nboost_librarydir in your native or cross machine file. Note that\nmachine file variables are preferred to environment variables, and\nthat specifying any of these disables system-wide search for boost.\nYou can set the argument threading to single to use boost\nlibraries that have been compiled for single-threaded use instead.\n"});
