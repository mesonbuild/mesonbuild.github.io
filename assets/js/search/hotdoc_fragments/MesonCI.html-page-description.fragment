fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"MesonCI.html#page-description","fragment":"This document is aimed for Meson contributors and documents the CI\nsetup used for testing Meson itself. The Meson project uses multiple\nCI platforms for covering a wide range of target systems.\nThe configuration files for GitHub actions are located in\n.github/workflows. Here, all images are tested\nwith the full run_tests.py run. Additionally, some other, smaller,\ntests are run.\nThe Linux docker images are automatically built and uploaded by GitHub\nactions. An image rebuild is triggerd when any of the image definition\nfiles are changed (in ci/ciimage) in the master branch.\nAdditionally, the images are also updated weekly.\nEach docker image has one corresponding dirctory in ci/ciimage with\nan image.json and an install.sh.\nThere are no manual Dockerfiles. Instead the Dockerfile is\nautomatically generated by the build.py script. This is done to\nensure that all images have the same layout and can all be built and\ntested automatically.\nThe Dockerfile is generated from the image.json file and basically\nonly adds a few common files and runs the install.sh script which\nshould contain all distribution specific setup steps. The common.sh\ncan be sourced via source /ci/common.sh to access some shared\nfunctionalety.\nTo generate the image run build.py -t build <image>. A generated\nimage can be tested with build.py -t test <image>.\nEach docker image has a /ci directory with an env_vars.sh script.\nThis script has to be sourced before running the Meson test suite.\n"});
