fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"MesonCI.html#page-description","fragment":"This document is aimed for Meson contributors and documents\nthe CI setup used for testing Meson itself. The Meson\nproject uses multiple CI platforms for covering a wide\nrange of target systems.\nThe configuration files for GitHub actions are located in\n.github/workflows. Here, all images\nare tested  with the full run_tests.py run. Additionally,\nsome other, smaller, tests are run.\nThe Linux docker images are automatically built and\nuploaded by GitHub actions. An image rebuild is triggerd\nwhen any of the image definition files are changed (in\nci/ciimage) in the master branch. Additionally, the\nimages are also updated weekly.\nEach docker image has one corresponding dirctory in\nci/ciimage with an image.json and an install.sh.\nThere are no manual Dockerfiles. Instead the Dockerfile is\nautomatically generated by the build.py script. This is\ndone to ensure that all images have the same layout and can\nall be built and tested automatically.\nThe Dockerfile is generated from the image.json file and\nbasically only adds a few common files and runs the\ninstall.sh script which should contain all distribution\nspecific setup steps. The common.sh can be sourced via\nsource /ci/common.sh to access some shared functionalety.\nTo generate the image run build.py -t build <image>. A\ngenerated image can be tested with build.py -t test <image>.\nEach docker image has a /ci directory with an\nenv_vars.sh script. This script has to be sourced before\nrunning the meson test suite.\n"});
