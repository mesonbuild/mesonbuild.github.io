fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"index.html#page-description","fragment":"Meson is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast,\nand, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.\nThe main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends\nwriting or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every\nsecond spent waiting for the build system to actually start compiling\ncode.\nAre you an absolute beginner when it comes to programming? No worries,\nread this beginner guide to get started.\nThe documentation on this site is freely available for all. However\nthere is also a full separate manual available for purchase on this\nweb page.\nThere are two main methods of connecting with other Meson\ndevelopers. The first one is the mailing list, which is hosted at\nGoogle Groups.\nThe second way is via IRC. The channel to use is #mesonbuild at\nFreenode.\nMany projects are using Meson and they're\na great resource for learning what to (and what not to!) do when\nconverting existing projects to Meson.\nA short list of Meson users can be found here\nbut there are many more. We would love to hear about your success\nstories too and how things could be improved too!\nAll development on Meson is done on the GitHub\nproject. Instructions for\ncontributing can be found on the contribution page.\nYou do not need to sign a CLA to contribute to Meson.\n\nmultiplatform support for Linux, macOS, Windows, GCC, Clang, Visual Studio and others\nsupported languages include C, C++, D, Fortran, Java, Rust\nbuild definitions in a very readable and user friendly non-Turing complete DSL\ncross compilation for many operating systems as well as bare metal\noptimized for extremely fast full and incremental builds without sacrificing correctness\nbuilt-in multiplatform dependency provider that works together with distro packages\nfun!\n\n"});
