fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Release-notes-for-1-7-0.html#cargo-features-are-resolved-globally","fragment":"Cargo features are resolved globally\nWhen configuring a Cargo dependency, Meson will now resolve its complete\ndependency tree and feature set before generating the subproject AST.\nThis solves many cases of Cargo subprojects being configured with missing\nfeatures that the main project had to enable by hand using e.g.\ndefault_options: ['foo-rs:feature-default=true'].\nNote that there could still be issues in the case there are multiple Cargo\nentry points. That happens if the main Meson project makes multiple dependency()\ncalls for different Cargo crates that have common dependencies.\nBreaks: This change removes per feature Meson options that were previously\npossible to set as shown above or from command line -Dfoo-rs:feature-foo=true.\n"});
