If the automatic $PS1\noverride is not desired (maybe you have a fancy custom prompt), set the\n$MESON_DISABLE_PS1_OVERRIDE environment variable and use $MESON_PROJECT_NAME\nwhen setting the custom prompt, for example with a snippet like the following:\nThese variables are set in environment in addition to those set using meson.add_devenv():\n\n\nMESON_DEVENV is defined to '1'.\n\nMESON_PROJECT_NAME is defined to the main project's name.\n\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH includes the directory where Meson generates -uninstalled.pc\nfiles.\n\nPATH includes every directory where there is an executable that would be\ninstalled into bindir. On windows it also includes every directory where there\nis a DLL needed to run those executables.\n\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH includes every directory where there is a shared library that\nwould be installed into libdir. This allows to run system application using\ncustom build of some libraries. For example running system GEdit when building\nGTK from git. On OSX the environment variable is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and\nPATH on Windows.\n\nGI_TYPELIB_PATH includes every directory where a GObject Introspection\ntypelib is built. This is automatically set when using gnome.generate_gir().\n\nGSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR Since 0.59.0 includes every directory where a GSettings\nschemas is compiled. This is automatically set when using gnome.compile_schemas().\nNote that this requires GLib >= 2.64 when gnome.compile_schemas() is used in\nmore than one directory.\n\n"});
