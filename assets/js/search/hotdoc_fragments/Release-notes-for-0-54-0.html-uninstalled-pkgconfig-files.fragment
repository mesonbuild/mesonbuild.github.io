For\nany generated foo.pc file, an extra foo-uninstalled.pc file is\nplaced into <builddir>/meson-uninstalled. They can be used to build\napplications against libraries built by Meson without installing them,\nby pointing PKG_CONFIG_PATH to that directory. This is an\nexperimental feature provided on a best-effort basis, it might not\nwork in all use-cases.\n"});
