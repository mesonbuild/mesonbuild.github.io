fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Feature-autodetection.html#coverage","fragment":"Coverage\nWhen doing a code coverage build, Meson will check for existence of\nthe binaries gcovr, lcov and genhtml. If version 3.3 or higher\nof the first is found, targets called coverage-text, coverage-xml\nand coverage-html are generated. Alternatively, if the latter two\nare found, only the target coverage-html is generated. Coverage\nreports can then be produced simply by calling e.g. meson compile coverage-xml. As a convenience, a high-level coverage target is\nalso generated which will produce all 3 coverage report types, if\npossible.\nNote that generating any of the coverage reports described above\nrequires the tests (i.e. meson test) to finish running so the\ninformation about the functions that are called in the tests can be\ngathered for the report.\n"});
