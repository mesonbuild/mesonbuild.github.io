First just create\nthe subprojects directory at the top of your source tree and issue\nthe install command.\nNow you can issue a subproject('libjpeg') in your meson.build file\nto use it.\nTo check if your projects are up to date you can issue the status command.\nIn this case zlib has a newer release available. Updating it is\nstraightforward:\nWraptool can do other things besides these. Documentation for these\ncan be found in the command line help, which can be accessed by\nmeson wrap --help.\n"});
