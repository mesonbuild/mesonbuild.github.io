fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Compiler-properties.html#expression-size","fragment":"Expression size\nOften you need to determine the size of a particular element (such as\nint, wchar_t or char*). Using the compiler variable mentioned\nabove, the check can be done like this.\nThis will put the size of wchar_t as reported by sizeof into\nvariable wcharsize. The keyword argument prefix is optional. If\nspecified its contents is put at the top of the source file. This\nargument is typically used for setting #include directives in\nconfiguration files.\nIn older versions (<= 0.30) Meson would error out if the size could\nnot be determined. Since version 0.31 it returns -1 if the size could\nnot be determined.\n"});
