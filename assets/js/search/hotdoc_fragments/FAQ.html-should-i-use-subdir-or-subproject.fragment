Subproject exists for a very\nspecific use case: embedding external dependencies into your build\nprocess. As an example, suppose we are writing a game and wish to use\nSDL. Let us further suppose that SDL comes with a Meson build\ndefinition. Let us suppose even further that we don't want to use\nprebuilt binaries but want to compile SDL for ourselves.\nIn this case you would use subproject. The way to do it would be to\ngrab the source code of SDL and put it inside your own source\ntree. Then you would do sdl = subproject('sdl'), which would cause\nMeson to build SDL as part of your build and would then allow you to\nlink against it or do whatever else you may prefer.\nFor every other use you would use subdir. As an example, if you\nwanted to build a shared library in one dir and link tests against it\nin another dir, you would do something like this:\n"});
