fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Pkgconfig-module.html#page-description","fragment":"This module is a simple generator for\npkg-config files.\nThe generated file's properties are specified with the following\nkeyword arguments.\nSince 0.46 a StaticLibrary or SharedLibrary object can optionally be passed\nas first positional argument. If one is provided a default value will be\nprovided for all required fields of the pc file:\nSince 0.54.0 uninstalled pkg-config files are generated as well. They are\nlocated in <build dir>/meson-uninstalled/. It is sometimes\nuseful to build projects against libraries built by meson without having to\ninstall them into a prefix. In order to do so, just set\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=<builddir>/meson-uninstalled before building your\napplication. That will cause pkg-config to prefer those -uninstalled.pc files\nand find libraries and headers from the meson builddir. This is an experimental\nfeature provided on a best-effort basis, it might not work in all use-cases.\nThe exact rules followed to find dependencies that are implicitly added into the\npkg-config file have evolved over time. Here are the rules as of Meson 0.49.0,\nprevious versions might have slightly different behaviour.\n\n\ndescription a string describing the library, used to set the Description: field\n\nextra_cflags a list of extra compiler flags to be added to the\nCflags field after the header search path\n\nfilebase the base name to use for the pkg-config file; as an\nexample, the value of libfoo would produce a pkg-config file called\nlibfoo.pc\n\n\ninstall_dir the directory to install to, defaults to the value of\noption libdir followed by /pkgconfig\n\n\nlibraries a list of built libraries (usually results of\nshared_library) that the user needs to link against. Arbitrary strings can\nalso be provided and they will be added into the Libs field. Since 0.45.0\ndependencies of built libraries will be automatically added, see the\nImplicit dependencies section below for the exact\nrules.\n\nlibraries_private list of built libraries or strings to put in the\nLibs.private field. Since 0.45.0 dependencies of built libraries will be\nautomatically added, see the Implicit dependencies\nsection below for the exact rules.\n\nname the name of this library, used to set the Name: field\n\nsubdirs which subdirs of include should be added to the header\nsearch path, for example if you install headers into\n${PREFIX}/include/foobar-1, the correct value for this argument\nwould be foobar-1\n\n\nrequires list of strings, pkgconfig-dependencies or libraries that\npkgconfig.generate() was used on to put in the Requires field\n\nrequires_private same as requires but for Requires.private field\nfield\n\nurl a string with a url for the library\n\nvariables a list of strings with custom variables to add to the\ngenerated file. The strings must be in the form name=value and may\nreference other pkgconfig variables,\ne.g. datadir=${prefix}/share. The names prefix, libdir and\ninstalldir are reserved and may not be used.\n\nversion a string describing the version of this library, used to set the\nVersion: field. (since 0.46.0) Defaults to the project version if unspecified.\n\nd_module_versions a list of module version flags used when compiling\nD sources referred to by this pkg-config file\n\nuninstalled_variables used instead of the variables keyword argument, when\ngenerating the uninstalled pkg-config file. Since 0.54.0\n\n\n\n\ninstall_dir is set to pkgconfig folder in the same location than the provided library.\n\ndescription is set to the project's name followed by the library's name.\n\nname is set to the library's name.\n\n\nNot found libraries or dependencies are ignored.\nLibraries and dependencies are private by default (i.e. added into\nRequires.private: or Libs.private:) unless they are explicitly added in\nlibraries or requires keyword arguments, or is the main library (first\npositional argument).\nLibraries and dependencies will be de-duplicated, if they are added in both\npublic and private (e.g Requires: and Requires.private:) it will be removed\nfrom the private list.\nShared libraries (i.e. shared_library() and NOT library()) add only\n-lfoo into Libs: or Libs.private: but their dependencies are not pulled.\nThis is because dependencies are only needed for static link.\nOther libraries (i.e. static_library() or library()) add -lfoo into Libs:\nor Libs.private: and recursively add their dependencies into Libs.private: or\nRequires.private:.\nDependencies provided by pkg-config are added into Requires: or\nRequires.private:. If a version was specified when declaring that dependency\nit will be written into the generated file too.\nThe threads dependency (i.e. dependency('threads')) adds -pthread into\nLibs: or Libs.private:.\nInternal dependencies (i.e.\ndeclare_dependency(compiler_args : '-DFOO', link_args : '-Wl,something', link_with : foo))\nadd compiler_args into Cflags: if public, link_args and link_with into\nLibs: if public or Libs.private: if private.\nOther dependency types add their compiler arguments into Cflags: if public,\nand linker arguments into Libs: if public or Libs.private: if private.\nOnce a pkg-config file is generated for a library using pkg.generate(mylib),\nany subsequent call to pkg.generate() where mylib appears, will generate a\nRequires: or Requires.private instead of a Libs: or Libs.private:.\n\n"});
