fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Use-of-Python.html#cross-platform-tooling","fragment":"Cross platform tooling\nThere is no one technical solution or programming language that works\nnatively on all operating systems currently in use. When Autotools was\ndesigned in the late 80s, Unix shell was available pretty much\nanywhere. This is no longer the case.\nIt is also the case that as any project gets larger, sooner or later\nit requires code generation, scripting or other tooling. This seems to\nbe inevitable. Because there is no scripting language that would be\navailable everywhere, these tools either need to be rewritten for each\nplatform (which is a lot of work and is prone to errors) or the\nproject needs to take a dependency on something.\nAny project that uses Meson (at least the current version) can rely on\nthe fact that Python 3 will always be available, because you can't\ncompile the project without it. All tooling can then be done in Python\n3 with the knowledge that it will run on any platform without any\nextra dependencies (modulo the usual porting work). This reduces\nmaintenance effort on multiplatform projects by a fair margin.\n"});
