fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Keyval-module.html#keyvalload","fragment":"keyval.load()\nThis function loads a file consisting of a series of key=value lines\nand returns a dictionary object.\nkeyval.load() makes no attempt at parsing the values in the file. In\nparticular boolean and integer values will be represented as strings,\nand strings will keep any quoting that is present in the input file.\nIt can be useful to create a\nconfiguration_data() object from the\ndictionary and use methods such as get_unquoted().\nKconfig frontends usually have \".config\" as the default name for the\nconfiguration file. However, placing the configuration file in the\nsource directory limits the user to one configuration per source\ndirectory. In order to allow separate configurations for each build\ndirectory, as is the Meson standard, meson.build should not hardcode\n\".config\" as the argument to kconfig.load(), and should instead make\nthe argument to kconfig.load() a project build\noption.\nReturns: a dict object.\n\nThe first (and only) argument is the path to the configuration file to\nload (usually \".config\").\n\n"});
