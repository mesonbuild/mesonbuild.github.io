The first argument is the\nproject id.\nAdditionally, sources can be passed as additional positional arguments. This\nwas, however, undocumented and never officially supported. Due to a longstanding\nbug, passing sources as a keyword argument will result in the positional\nargument sources to be ignored. since 0.60.0 A warning is raised in this case.\nSince 0.60.0 the use of the positional argument sources has been deprecated,\nand the \"sources\" keyword argument should be used instead. The passing of\nsources as positional arguments will be removed in the future.\nThis also creates two targets for translations\nhelp-$project-update-po and help-$project-pot.\nNote that very old versions of yelp may not support symlinked media;\nAt least 3.10 should work.\nAdded 0.36.0\n\n\nlanguages: list of languages for translations\n\nmedia: list of media such as images\n\nsources: list of pages\n\nsymlink_media: if media should be symlinked not copied (defaults to true since 0.42.0)\n\n"});
