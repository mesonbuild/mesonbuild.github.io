This is done by setting the d_unittest target\nproperty to true. Meson will only ever pass the respective\ncompiler's -unittest flag, and never have the compiler generate an\nempty main function. If you need that feature in a portable way,\ncreate an empty main() function for unittests yourself, since the\nGNU D compiler does not have this feature.\nThis is an example for using D unittests with Meson:\n"});
