As before this remains possible only with the Ninja backend. \nThe Vala compiler has an alternative syntax Genie that uses the gs file extension. Meson now recognises and uses Genie files. \nThe Pkgconfig module object can add arbitrary extra cflags to the Cflags value in the pc file using the extra_cflags keyword \nBase options are now accessible via the get_option function. \nRust targets now take an optional rust_crate_type keyword allowing you to set the crate type of the resulting artifact. Valid crate types are dylib or cdylib for shared libraries and rlib or staticlib for static libraries. For more see Rust s linkage reference. \nBoth the address and undefined behavior sanitizers can now be used simultaneously by passing Db_sanitize address undefined to Meson. \nThe new keyword implib to executable allows generation of an import library for the executable. \nYou can specify build_rpath foo bar in build targets and the given path will get added to the target s rpath in the build tree. It is removed during the install step. \nMeson will print a warning when the user tries to add an rpath linker flag manually e.g. via link_args to a target. This is not recommended because having multiple rpath causes them to stomp on each other. This warning will become a hard error in some future release. \nWith the Ninja backend it is now possible to limit the maximum number of concurrent linker processes. This is usually only needed for projects that have many large link steps that cause the system to run out of memory if they are run in parallel. This limit can be set with the new backend_max_links option. \nBy default Meson adds the current source and build directories to the header search path. On some rare occasions this is not desired. Setting the implicit_include_directories keyword argument to false these directories are not used. \nThe install_subdir command accepts the new exclude_files and exclude_directories keyword arguments that allow specified files or directories to be excluded from the installed subdirectory. \nPreviously Meson had multiple executables such as mesonintrospect and mesontest. They are now invokable via the main Meson executable like this \nThe old commands are still available but they are deprecated and will be removed in some future release. \nMost libraries and applications use the same standard templates for glib mkenums. There is now a new mkenums_simple convenience method that passes those default templates to glib mkenums and allows some tweaks such as optional function decorators or leading underscores. \n"});
