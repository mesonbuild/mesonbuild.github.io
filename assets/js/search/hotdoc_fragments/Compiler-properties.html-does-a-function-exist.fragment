fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Compiler-properties.html#does-a-function-exist","fragment":"Does a function exist?\nJust having a header doesn't say anything about its contents.\nSometimes you need to explicitly check if some function exists. This\nis how we would check whether the function open_memstream exists in\nheader stdio.h\nNote that, on macOS programs can be compiled targeting older macOS\nversions than the one that the program is compiled on. It can't be\nassumed that the OS version that is compiled on matches the OS version\nthat the binary will run on.\nTherefore when detecting function availability with has_function, it\nis important to specify the correct header in the prefix argument.\nIn the example above, the function open_memstream is detected, which\nwas introduced in macOS 10.13. When the user builds on macOS 10.13,\nbut targeting macOS 10.11 (-mmacosx-version-min=10.11), this will\ncorrectly report the function as missing. Without the header however,\nit would lack the necessary availability information and incorrectly\nreport the function as available.\n"});
