It is only provided as a technology\npreview.  Its API may change in arbitrary ways between releases or it\nmight be removed from Meson altogether.\nThis module provides an experimental method to create FPGA bitstreams using\nthe IceStorm suite of tools.\nThe module exposes only one method called project and it is used\nlike this:\nThe input to this function is the set of Verilog files and a\nconstraint file. This produces output files called projname.asc,\nprojname.blif and projname.bin. In addition it creates two run\ntargets called projname-time for running timing analysis and\nprojname-upload that uploads the generated bitstream to an FPGA\ndevice using the iceprog programming executable.\n"});
