It is therefore now possible to use arbitrary\nbytes in strings, like for example NUL (\\0) and other ASCII\ncontrol characters. See the chapter about Strings in\nSyntax for more details.\nPotential backwards compatibility issue: Any valid escape sequence\naccording to the new rules will be interpreted as an escape sequence\ninstead of the literal characters. Previously only the following\nescape sequences were supported in single-quote strings: \\', \\\\\nand \\n.\nNote that the behaviour of triple-quoted (multiline) strings has not\nchanged. They behave like raw strings and do not support any escape\nsequences.\n"});
