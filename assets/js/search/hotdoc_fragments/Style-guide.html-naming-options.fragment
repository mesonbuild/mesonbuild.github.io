As an example for\nbooleans the first one is foo and the second one is enable-foo.\nThe former style is recommended, because in Meson options have strong\ntype, rather than being just strings.\nYou should try to name options the same as is common in other\nprojects. This is especially important for yielding options, because\nthey require that both the parent and subproject options have the same\nname.\n"});
