fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual.html#test","fragment":"test()\nDefines a test to run with the test harness. Takes two positional\narguments, the first is the name of the test and the second is the\nexecutable to run. The executable can be an executable build target\nobject returned by\nexecutable() or an external program\nobject returned by\nfind_program().\n(since 0.55.0) When cross compiling, if an exe_wrapper is needed and\ndefined the environment variable MESON_EXE_WRAPPER will be set to\nthe string value of that wrapper (implementation detail: using\nmesonlib.join_args). Test scripts may use this to run cross built\nbinaries. If your test needs MESON_EXE_WRAPPER in cross build\nsituations it is your responsibility to return code 77 to tell the\nharness to report \"skip\".\nBy default, environment variable\nMALLOC_PERTURB_\nis automatically set by meson test to a random value between 1..255.\nThis can help find memory leaks on configurations using glibc,\nincluding with non-GCC compilers. However, this can have a performance\nimpact, and may fail a test due to external libraries whose internals\nare out of the user's control. To check if this feature is causing an\nexpected runtime crash, disable the feature by temporarily setting\nenvironment variable MALLOC_PERTURB_=0. While it's preferable to\nonly temporarily disable this check, if a project requires permanent\ndisabling of this check in meson.build do like:\n"});
