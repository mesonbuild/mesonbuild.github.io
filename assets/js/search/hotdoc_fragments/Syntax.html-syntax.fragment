fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Syntax.html#syntax","fragment":"Syntax\nThe syntax of Meson's specification language has been kept as simple\nas possible. It is strongly typed so no object is ever converted to\nanother under the covers. Variables have no visible type which makes\nMeson dynamically typed (also known as duck typed).\nThe main building blocks of the language are variables, numbers,\nbooleans, strings, arrays, function calls, method calls, if\nstatements and includes.\nUsually one Meson statement takes just one line. There is no way to\nhave multiple statements on one line as in e.g. C. Function and\nmethod calls' argument lists can be split over multiple lines. Meson\nwill autodetect this case and do the right thing.\nIn other cases, (added 0.50) you can get multi-line statements by\nending the line with a \\. Apart from line ending whitespace has no\nsyntactic meaning.\n"});
