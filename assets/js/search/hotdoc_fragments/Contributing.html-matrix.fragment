Each key in the options dict is a Meson option. It stores\na list of all potential values in a dict format, which allows to skip\nspecific values based on the current environment.\nEach value must contain the val key for the value of the option.\nnull can be used for adding matrix entries without the current\noption.\nAdditionally, the skip_on_env key can be used to specify a list of\nenvironment variables. If at least one environment variable in\nskip_on_env is present, all matrix entries containing this value are\nskipped.\nSimilarly, the compilers key can be used to define a mapping of\ncompilers to languages that are required for this value.\nSpecific option combinations can be excluded with the exclude\nsection. It should be noted that exclude does not require exact\nmatches. Instead, any matrix entry containing all option value\ncombinations in exclude will be excluded. Thus an empty dict ({})\nto will match all elements in the test matrix.\nThe above example will produce the following matrix entries:\n\nopt1=abc\nopt1=abc opt2=true\nopt1=abc opt2=false\nopt1=qwert\nopt1=qwert opt2=true\n\n"});
