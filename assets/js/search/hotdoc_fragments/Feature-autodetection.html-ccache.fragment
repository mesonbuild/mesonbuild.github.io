When you run Meson for the first time for a given\nproject, it checks if Ccache is installed. If it is, Meson will use it\nautomatically.\nIf you do not wish to use Ccache for some reason, just specify your\ncompiler with environment variables CC and/or CXX when first\nrunning Meson (remember that once specified the compiler cannot be\nchanged). Meson will then use the specified compiler without Ccache.\n"});
