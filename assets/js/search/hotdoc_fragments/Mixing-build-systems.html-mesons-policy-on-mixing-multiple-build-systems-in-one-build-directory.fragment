The build\ndirectories do not necessarily need to be inside each other, but that\nis the common case.\nThis page lists the Meson project's stance on mixing build systems.\nThe tl/dr version is that while we do provide some functionality for\nthis use case, it only works for simple cases. Anything more complex\ncannot be made reliable and trying to do that would burden Meson\ndevelopers with an effectively infinite maintenance burden. Thus these\nuse cases are not guaranteed to work, and even if a project using them\nworks today there are no guarantees that it will work in any future\nversion.\n"});
