Merely replace the contents of\nsdlprog.c with the following:\nLet's try to compile this by running meson compile -C builddir again.\n\nThat fails. The reason for this is that we don't actually have SDL\ncurrently available. We need to obtain it somehow. In more technical\nterms SDL2 is an external dependency and obtaining it is called\ndependency resolution.\nMeson has a web service for downloading and building (if needed)\ndependencies called a WrapDB. It provides SDL2 so we can use it\ndirectly. First we need to create a subprojects directory because in\nMeson all subprojects like these must be stored in that directory for\nconsistency.\nThen we can install the dependency:\nIt looks like this:\n\nAs a final step we need to update our build definition file to use the\nnewly obtained dependency.\nIn addition to the dependency this has a few other changes. First we\nspecify that we want to build helper libraries statically. For simple\nprojects like these it makes things simpler. We also need to tell\nMeson that the program we are building is a Windows GUI\napplication rather than a console application.\nThis is all we need to do and can now run meson compile again. First\nthe system downloads and configures SDL2:\n\nA bit later the compilation exits succesfully.\n\n"});
