As an example you could do this. \nThis makes Meson add the define to all C compilations. Usually you would use this setting for flags for global settings. Note that for setting the C C language standard the std c99 argument in GCC you would probably want to use a default option of the project function. For details see the reference manual. \nGlobal arguments have certain limitations. They all have to be defined before any build targets are specified. This ensures that the global flags are the same for every single source file built in the entire project with one exception. Compilation tests that are run as part of your project configuration do not use these flags. The reason for that is that you may need to run a test compile with and without a given flag to determine your build setup. For this reason tests do not use these global arguments. \nYou should set only the most essential flags with this setting you should not set debug or optimization flags. Instead they should be specified by selecting an appropriate build type. \n"});
