Entries defined in\nthe [constants] section can be used in any other section (they are\nalways parsed first), entries in any other section can be used only\nwithin that same section and only after it has been defined.\nThis can be useful with cross file composition as well. A generic\ncross file could be composed with a platform specific file where\nconstants are defined:\nThis can be used as meson setup --cross-file aarch64.ini --cross-file cross.ini builddir.\nNote that file composition happens before the parsing of values.
