This is useful for developers who wish to use the project without\ninstalling it, it is often needed to set for example the path to plugins\ndirectory, etc. Alternatively, a list or dictionary can be passed as first\nargument.\nNew command line has been added: meson devenv -C builddir [<command>].\nIt runs a command, or open interactive shell if no command is provided, with\nenvironment setup to run project from the build directory, without installation.\nThese variables are set in environment in addition to those set using meson.add_devenv():\n\n\nMESON_DEVENV is defined to '1'.\n\nMESON_PROJECT_NAME is defined to the main project's name.\n\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH includes the directory where Meson generates -uninstalled.pc\nfiles.\n\nPATH includes every directory where there is an executable that would be\ninstalled into bindir. On windows it also includes every directory where there\nis a DLL needed to run those executables.\n\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH includes every directory where there is a shared library that\nwould be installed into libdir. This allows to run system application using\ncustom build of some libraries. For example running system GEdit when building\nGTK from git. On OSX the environment variable is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and\nPATH on Windows.\n\nGI_TYPELIB_PATH includes every directory where a GObject Introspection\ntypelib is built. This is automatically set when using gnome.generate_gir().\n\n"});
