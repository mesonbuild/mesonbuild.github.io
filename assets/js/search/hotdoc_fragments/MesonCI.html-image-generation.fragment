This is done to\nensure that all images have the same layout and can all be built and\ntested automatically.\nThe Dockerfile is generated from the image.json file and basically\nonly adds a few common files and runs the install.sh script which\nshould contain all distribution specific setup steps. The common.sh\ncan be sourced via source /ci/common.sh to access some shared\nfunctionalety.\nTo generate the image run build.py -t build <image>. A generated\nimage can be tested with build.py -t test <image>.\n"});
