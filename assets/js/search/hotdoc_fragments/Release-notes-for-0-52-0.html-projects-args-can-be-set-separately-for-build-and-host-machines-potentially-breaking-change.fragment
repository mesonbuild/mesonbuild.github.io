The rules are now very simple:\nnative: true affects native: true targets\nnative: false affects native: false targets\nNo native flag is the same as native: false\nThis further simplifies behavior to match the \"build vs host\" decision\ndone in last release with c_args vs build_c_args. The underlying\nmotivation in both cases is to execute the same commands whether the\noverall build is native or cross.\n\n\nnative: true affects native: true targets\n\n\nnative: false affects native: false targets\n\n\nNo native flag is the same as native: false\n\n\n"});
