fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual.html#subdir","fragment":"subdir()\nEnters the specified subdirectory and executes the meson.build file\nin it. Once that is done, it returns and execution continues on the\nline following this subdir() command. Variables defined in that\nmeson.build file are then available for use in later parts of the\ncurrent build file and in all subsequent build files executed with\nsubdir().\nNote that this means that each meson.build file in a source tree can\nand must only be executed once.\nThis function has one keyword argument.\n\n\nif_found: takes one or several dependency objects and will only\nrecurse in the subdir if they all return true when queried with\n.found()\n\n\n"});
