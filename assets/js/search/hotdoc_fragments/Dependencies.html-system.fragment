fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Dependencies.html#system","fragment":"System\nSome dependencies provide no valid methods for discovery, or do so only in\nsome cases. Some examples of this are Zlib, which provides both pkg-config\nand cmake, except when it is part of the base OS image (such as in FreeBSD\nand macOS); OpenGL which has pkg-config on Unices from glvnd or mesa, but has\nno pkg-config on macOS and Windows.\nIn these cases Meson provides convenience wrappers in the form of system\ndependencies. Internally these dependencies do exactly what a user would do\nin the build system DSL or with a script, likely calling\ncompiler.find_library(), setting link_with and include_directories. By\nputting these in Meson upstream the barrier of using them is lowered, as\nprojects using Meson don't have to re-implement the logic.\n"});
