However this is not enough to reliably\ndifferentiate between e.g. an iOS platform from a watchOS one. Two new\nproperties, namely kernel and subsystem have been added so these\nsetups can be reliably detected.\nThese new properties are not necessary in cross files for now, but if\nthey are not defined and a build file tries to access them, Meson will\nexit with a hard error. It is expected that at some point in the\nfuture defining the new properties will become mandatory.\n"});
