fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Unit-tests.html#priorities","fragment":"Priorities\n(added in version 0.52.0)\nTests can be assigned a priority that determines when a test is\nstarted. Tests with higher priority are started first, tests with\nlower priority started later. The default priority is 0, Meson makes\nno guarantee on the ordering of tests with identical priority.\nNote that the test priority only affects the starting order of tests\nand subsequent tests are affected by how long it takes previous tests\nto complete. It is thus possible that a higher-priority test is still\nrunning when lower-priority tests with a shorter runtime have\ncompleted.\n"});
