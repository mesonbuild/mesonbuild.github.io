In some rare occasions they could not be\nreplaced by meson.project_source_root() or meson.current_source_dir(), in\nwhich case the new methods can now be used instead. Old methods are still\ndeprecated because their names are not explicit enough and created many issues\nwhen a project is being used as a subproject.\n"});
