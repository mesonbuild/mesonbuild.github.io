Unfortunately, import libraries are also called foo.lib.\nThis causes filename collisions with the default library type where we\nbuild both shared and static libraries, and also causes collisions\nduring installation since all libraries are installed to the same\ndirectory by default.\nTo resolve this, we decided to default to creating static libraries of\nthe form libfoo.a when building with MSVC. This has the following\nadvantages:\nIf, for some reason, you really need your project to output static\nlibraries of the form foo.lib when building with MSVC, you can set\nthe\nname_prefix:\nkwarg to '' and the\nname_suffix:\nkwarg to 'lib'. To get the default behaviour for each, you can\neither not specify the kwarg, or pass [] (an empty array) to it.\n"});
