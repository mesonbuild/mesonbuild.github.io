To examine this difference we compared the\nperformance of Meson with GNU Autotools. We took the GLib software\nproject and rewrote its build setup with Meson. GLib was chosen\nbecause it is a relatively large C code base which requires lots of\nlow level configuration.\nThe Meson version of the build system is not fully equivalent to the\noriginal Autotools one. It does not do all the same configuration\nsteps and does not build all the same targets. The biggest missing\npiece being internationalisation support with Gettext. However it does\nconfigure the system enough to build all C source and run all unit\ntests.\nAll measurements were done on a Nexus 4 smart phone running the latest\nUbuntu touch image (updated on September 9th 2013).\n"});
