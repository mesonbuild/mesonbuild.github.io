fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Localisation.html#page-description","fragment":"Localising your application with GNU gettext takes a little effort but\nis quite straightforward. We'll create a po subdirectory at your\nproject root directory for all the localisation info.\nIn your main meson.build file include the po subdirectory in the build process.\nIn this po subdirectory we need:\nFile with space separated list of languages. A sample LINGUAS might look like this.\nFile that lists all the source files that gettext should scan in order\nto find strings to translate. The syntax of the file is one line per\nsource file and the line must contain the relative path from source\nroot. A sample POTFILES might look like this.\nLocalization specific meson file. It imports and uses the i18n\nmodule. If not defined before it needs to define the GETTEXT_PACKAGE\nglobal.\nThe first command imports the i18n module that provides gettext\nfeatures. The fourth line does the actual invocation. The first\nargument is the gettext package name. This causes two things to\nhappen. The first is that Meson will generate binary mo files and put\nthem to their proper locations when doing an install. The second is\nthat it creates a build rule to regenerate the main pot file. If you\nare using the Ninja backend, this is how you would invoke the rebuild.\nThen we need to generate the main pot file. The potfile can have any\nname but is usually the name of the gettext package. Let's say the\nproject is called intltest. In this case the corresponding pot file\nwould be called intltest.pot.\nRun the following command from your build folder to generate the pot\nfile. It is recommended to inspect it manually afterwards and fill in\ne.g. proper copyright and contact information.\nFor each language listed in the array above we need a corresponding\n.po file. Those can be generated by running the following command\nfrom your build folder.\n\n\nLINGUAS: Space separated list of languages\n\nPOTFILES: List of source files to scan for translatable strings.\n\nmeson.build: Localization specific meson file\n\n"});
