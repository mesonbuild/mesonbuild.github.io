fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Dependencies.html#jni","fragment":"JNI\n(added 0.62.0)\nProvides access to compiling with the Java Native Interface (JNI). The lookup\nwill first check if JAVA_HOME is set in the environment, and if not will use\nthe resolved path of javac. Systems will usually link your preferred JDK to\nwell known paths like /usr/bin/javac on Linux for instance. Using the path\nfrom JAVA_HOME or the resolved javac, this dependency will place the JDK\ninstallation's include directory and its platform-dependent subdirectory on\nthe compiler's include path.\nNote: Due to usage of a resolved path, upgrading the JDK may cause the\nvarious headers to not be found. In that case, please reconfigure the build\ndirectory. One workaround is to explicitly set JAVA_HOME instead of relying on\nthe fallback javac resolved path behavior.\n"});
