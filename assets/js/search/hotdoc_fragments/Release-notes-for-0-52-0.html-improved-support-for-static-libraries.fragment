This release brings many\ninternal changes in the way they are handled, including:\nMany projects have been using extract_all_objects() to work around\nthose issues, and hopefully those hacks could now be removed. Since\nthis is a pretty large change, please double check if your static\nlibraries behave correctly, and report any regression.\n\n\nlink_whole: of static libraries. In the example below, lib2 used to miss\nsymbols from lib1 and was unusable.\n\n\n\nlink_with: of a static library with an uninstalled static library. In the\nexample below, lib2 now implicitly promote link_with: to link_whole: because\nthe installed lib2 would otherwise be unusable.\n\n\npkg-config generator do not include uninstalled static libraries. In the example\nbelow, the generated .pc file used to be unusable because it contained\nLibs.private: -llib1 and lib1.a is not installed. lib1 is now omitted\nfrom the .pc file because the link_with: has been promoted to\nlink_whole: (see above) and thus lib1 is not needed to use lib2.\n\n"});
