The Java module allows users to\ngenerate native header files without needing to use a custom_target().\n== Link tests can use sources for a different compiler ==\nUsually, the links method of the compiler object uses a single program\ninvocation to do both compilation and linking.  Starting with this version,\nwhenever the argument to links is a file, Meson will check if the file\nsuffix matches the compiler object's language.  If they do not match,\nas in the following case:\nthen Meson will separate compilation and linking.  In the above example\ntest.c will be compiled with a C compiler and the resulting object file\nwill be linked with a C++ compiler.  This makes it possible to detect\nmisconfigurations of the compilation environment, for example when the\nC++ runtime is not compatible with the one expected by the C compiler.\nFor this reason, passing file arguments with an unrecognized suffix to\nlinks will cause a warning.\n"});
