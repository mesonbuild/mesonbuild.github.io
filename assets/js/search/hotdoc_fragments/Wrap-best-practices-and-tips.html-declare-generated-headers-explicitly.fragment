Rather than processing things directory per directory, it\nlooks at the entire build definition at once and runs the individual\ncompile jobs in what might look to the outside as a random order.\nThe reason for this is that this is much more efficient so your builds\nfinish faster. The downside is that you have to be careful with your\ndependencies. The most common problem here is headers that are\ngenerated at compile time with e.g. code generators. If these headers\nare needed when building code that uses these libraries, the compile\njob might be run before the code generation step. The fix is to make\nthe dependency explicit like this:\nAnd then you can use the dependency in the usual way:\nMeson will ensure that the header file has been built before compiling main.c.\n"});
