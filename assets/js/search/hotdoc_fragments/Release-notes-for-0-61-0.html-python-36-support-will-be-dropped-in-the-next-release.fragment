The only LTS distribution that\nstill ships Python 3.5 as the default Python is Ubuntu 18.04, which has Python\n3.8 available as well.\nPython 3.7 has various features that we find useful such as future annotations,\nthe importlib.resources module, and dataclasses.\nAs a result, we will begin requiring Python 3.7 or newer in Meson 0.62, which\nis the next release. Starting with Meson 0.61, we now print a NOTICE: when\na meson command is run on Python 3.6 to inform users about this.\n"});
