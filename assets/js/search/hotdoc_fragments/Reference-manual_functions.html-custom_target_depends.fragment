fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#custom_target_depends","fragment":"Specifies that this target depends on the specified\ntarget(s), even though it does not take any of them as a command\nline argument. This is meant for cases where you have a tool that\ne.g. does globbing internally. Usually you should just put the\ngenerated sources as inputs and Meson will set up all dependencies\nautomatically (custom_idx was unavailable as a type between 0.60\nand 1.4.0).\n"});
