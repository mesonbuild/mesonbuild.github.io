fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Vala.html#using-libraries","fragment":"Using libraries\nMeson uses the dependency()\nfunction to find the relevant VAPI, C headers and linker flags when it\nencounters a Vala source file in a build target. Vala needs a VAPI\nfile and a C header or headers to use a library. The VAPI file helps\nmap Vala code to the library's C programming interface. It is the\npkg-config\ntool that makes finding these installed files all work seamlessly\nbehind the scenes. When a pkg-config file doesn't exist for the\nlibrary then the find_library()\nmethod of the compiler object\nneeds to be used. Examples are given later.\nNote Vala uses libraries that follow the C Application Binary Interface (C ABI).\nThe library, however, could be written in C, Vala, Rust, Go, C++ or any other\nlanguage that can generate a binary compatible with the C ABI and so provides C\nheaders.\n"});
