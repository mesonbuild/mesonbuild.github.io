fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Vala.html#adding-to-valas-search-path","fragment":"Adding to Vala's search path\nSo far we have covered the cases where the VAPI file is either\ndistributed with Vala or the library. A VAPI can also be included in\nthe source files of your project. The convention is to put it in the\nvapi directory of your project.\nThis is needed when a library does not have a VAPI or your project\nneeds to link to another component in the project that uses the C ABI.\nFor example if part of the project is written in C.\nThe Vala compiler's --vapidir option is used to add the project\ndirectory to the VAPI search path. In Meson this is done with the\nadd_project_arguments() function:\nIf the VAPI is for an external library then make sure that the VAPI\nname corresponds to the pkg-config file name.\nThe vala-extra-vapis\nrepository is a\ncommunity maintained repository of VAPIs that are not distributed.\nDevelopers use the repository to share early work on new bindings and\nimprovements to existing bindings. So the VAPIs can frequently change.\nIt is recommended VAPIs from this repository are copied into your\nproject's source files.\nThis also works well for starting to write new bindings before they\nare shared with the vala-extra-vapis repository.\n"});
