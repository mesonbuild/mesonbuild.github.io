If Meson detects that gcovr will load this file, it no\nlonger excludes the subprojects/ directory from coverage. It's a good default\nfor Meson to guess that projects want to ignore it, but not all projects prefer\nthat and it is assumed that if a gcovr.cfg exists then it will manually\ninclude/exclude desired paths.\nlcov supports .lcovrc, but only as a systemwide or user setting. This is\nnon-ideal for projects, so Meson will now detect one in the project source root\nand, if present, manually tell lcov to use it.\n"});
