Rust module's that do not need abuild.rsfile need no intervention, whereas if abuild.rs` file is present it needs to be\nconverted manually to Meson code.\nTo enable automatic configuration of Cargo dependencies, your project must\nhave Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files in the root source directory;\nthis enables proper feature resolution across crates.
