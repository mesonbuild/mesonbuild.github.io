You are allowed to run arbitrary commands during\nconfiguration. First you need to write a script that locates the files\nto compile. Here's a simple shell script that writes all .c files in\nthe current directory, one per line.\nThen you need to run this script in your Meson file, convert the\noutput into a string array and use the result in a target.\nThe script can be any executable, so it can be written in shell,\nPython, Lua, Perl or whatever you wish.\nAs mentioned above, the tradeoff is that just adding new files to the\nsource directory does not add them to the build automatically. To\nadd them you need to tell Meson to reinitialize itself. The simplest\nway is to touch the meson.build file in your source root. Then Meson\nwill reconfigure itself next time the build command is run. Advanced\nusers can even write a small background script that utilizes a\nfilesystem event queue, such as\ninotify, to do this\nautomatically.\n"});
