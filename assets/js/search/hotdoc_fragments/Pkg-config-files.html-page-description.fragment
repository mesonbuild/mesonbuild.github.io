The second way is to use Meson's built in Pkg-config file\ngenerator. The difference between the two is that the latter is very\nsimple and meant for basic use cases. The former should be used when\nyou need to provide a more customized solution.\nIn this document we describe the simple generator approach. It is used in the following way.\nThis causes a file called simple.pc to be created and placed into\nthe install directory during the install phase.\nMore information on the pkg-config module and the parameters can be\nfound on the pkgconfig-module page.\n"});
