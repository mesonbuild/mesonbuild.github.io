Must not add complexity due to obsolete platforms\nWork on this build system started during the Christmas holidays of 2012.\nThis provides a natural hard cutoff line of 2012/12/24. Any\nplatform, tool or library that was not in active use at that time is\nexplicitly not supported. These include Unixes such as IRIX, SunOS,\nOSF-1, Ubuntu versions older than 12/10, GCC versions older than 4.7\nand so on. If these old versions happen to work, great. If they don't,\nnot a single line of code will be added to the system to work around\ntheir bugs.\n"});
