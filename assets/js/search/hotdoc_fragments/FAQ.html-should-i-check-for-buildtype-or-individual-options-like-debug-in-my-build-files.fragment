The\nÂ´buildtype` option is meant do describe the current build's\nintent. That is, what it will be used for. Individual options are\nfor determining what the exact state is. This becomes clearer with a\nfew examples.\nSuppose you have a source file that is known to miscompile when using\n-O3 and requires a workaround. Then you'd write something like this:\nOn the other hand if your project has extra logging and sanity checks\nthat you would like to be enabled during the day to day development\nwork (which uses the debug buildtype), you'd do this instead:\nIn this way the extra options are automatically used during\ndevelopment but are not compiled in release builds. Note that (since\nMeson 0.57.0) you can set optimization to, say, 2 in your debug builds\nif you want to. If you tried to set this flag based on optimization\nlevel, it would fail in this case.\n"});
