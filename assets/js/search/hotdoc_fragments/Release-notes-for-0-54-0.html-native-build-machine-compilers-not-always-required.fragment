fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Release-notes-for-0-54-0.html#native-build-machine-compilers-not-always-required","fragment":"Native (build machine) compilers not always required\nadd_languages() gained a native: keyword, indicating if a native or cross\ncompiler is to be used.\nFor the benefit of existing simple build definitions which don't\ncontain any native: true targets, without breaking backwards\ncompatibility for build definitions which assume that the native\ncompiler is available after add_languages(), if the native:\nkeyword is absent the languages may be used for either the build or\nhost machine, but are never required for the build machine.\nThis changes the behaviour of the following Meson fragment (when\ncross-compiling but a native compiler is not available) from reporting\nan error at add_language to reporting an error at executable.\n"});
