This allows the Meson project to enforce a consistent\nstyle of the Reference Manual and enables easier style changes to the generated\nMarkdown files without touching the actual documentation.\nAdditionally, multiple generation backends can be supported (besides the\nMarkdown generator for mesonbuild.com).\nThe generator that reads these YAML files is located in docs/refman, with the\nmain executable being docs/genrefman.py.\n"});
