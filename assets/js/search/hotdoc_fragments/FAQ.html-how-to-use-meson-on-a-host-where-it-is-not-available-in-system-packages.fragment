Meson\nhas been designed to be easily runnable from an extracted source\ntarball or even a git checkout. First you need to download Meson. Then\nuse this command to set up you build instead of plain meson.\nAfter this you don't have to care about invoking Meson any more. It\nremembers where it was originally invoked from and calls itself\nappropriately. As a user the only thing you need to do is to cd into\nyour build directory and invoke meson compile.\n"});
