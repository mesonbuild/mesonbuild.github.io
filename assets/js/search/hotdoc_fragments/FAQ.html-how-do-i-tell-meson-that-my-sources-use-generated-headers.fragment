Here's how\nyou ensure that Meson generates the headers before trying to compile any\nsources in the build target:\nNow let's say you have a new target that links to libfoo:\nThis adds a link-time dependency between the two targets, but note that the\nsources of the targets have no compile-time dependencies and can be built\nin any order; which improves parallelism and speeds up builds.\nIf the sources in libbar also use foo-gen.h, that's a compile-time\ndependency, and you'll have to add libfoo_gen_headers to sources: for\nlibbar too:\nAlternatively, if you have multiple libraries with sources that link to\na library and also use its generated headers, this code is equivalent to above:\nNote: You should only add headers to sources: while declaring\na dependency. If your custom target outputs both sources and headers, you can\nuse the subscript notation to get only the header(s):\nA good example of a generator that outputs both sources and headers is\ngnome.mkenums().\n"});
