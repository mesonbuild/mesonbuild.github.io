As before, the full log is\nalways available inside the builddir in meson-logs/install-log.txt.\nWhen this option is passed, install scripts will have the environment\nvariable MESON_INSTALL_QUIET set.\nNumerous speed-ups were also made for the install step, especially on\nWindows where it is now 300% to 1200% faster than before depending on\nyour workload.\n"});
