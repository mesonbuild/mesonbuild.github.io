More than one file can be loaded, with values from a previous\nfile being overridden by the next. The intention of this is not\noverriding, but to allow composing files. This composition is done by\npassing the command line argument multiple times:\nIn this case first.ini will be loaded, then second.ini, with\nvalues from second.ini replacing first.ini, and so on.\nFor example, if there is a project using C and C++, python 3.4-3.7,\nand LLVM 5-7, and it needs to build with clang 5, 6, and 7, and gcc\n5.x, 6.x, and 7.x; expressing all of these configurations in\nmonolithic configurations would result in 81 different native files.\nBy layering them, it can be expressed by just 12 native files.\n"});
