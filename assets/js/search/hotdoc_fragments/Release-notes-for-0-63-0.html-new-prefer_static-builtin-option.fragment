This option acts as\nstrictly a preference. If the preferred linking method is not successful,\nthen Meson will fallback and try the other linking method. Specifically\nsetting the static kwarg in the meson.build will take precedence over\nthe value of prefer_static for that specific dependency or\nfind_library call.\n"});
