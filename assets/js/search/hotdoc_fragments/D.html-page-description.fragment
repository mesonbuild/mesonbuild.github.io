You should generate a pkg config file and install it in order to make other software on the system find the dependency once it is installed. \nThis is an example on how to build a D shared library \nIt is important to make the D sources install in a subdirectory in the include path in this case usr include d mylib mylib. All D compilers include the usr include d directory by default and if your library would be installed into usr include d mylib there is a high chance that when you compile your project again on a machine where you installed it the compiler will prefer the old installed include over the new version in the source tree leading to very confusing errors. \nThis is an example of how to use the D library we just built and installed in an application \nPlease keep in mind that the library and executable would both need to be built with the exact same D compiler and D compiler version. The D ABI is not stable across compilers and their versions and mixing compilers will lead to problems. \n"});
