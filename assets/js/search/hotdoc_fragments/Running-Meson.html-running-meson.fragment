First, you can run it\ndirectly from the source tree with the command\n/path/to/source/meson.py. Second, Meson may also be installed in which case\nthe command is simply meson. In this manual we only use the latter\nformat for simplicity.\nAt the time of writing only a command line version of Meson is\navailable. This means that Meson must be invoked using the terminal.\nIf you wish to use the MSVC compiler, you need to run Meson under\n\"Visual Studio command prompt\".\nAll available Meson commands are listed on the commands reference\npage.\n"});
