This is meant to be used for cases where the program may have many alternative names such as foo and foo.py. The function will check for the arguments one by one and the first one that is found is returned. Meson versions earlier than only accept one argument. \nIf none of the programs are found Meson will abort. You can tell it not to by setting the keyword argument required to false and then use the found method on the returned object to check whether it was found or not. \nThe returned object also has methods that are documented in the object methods section below. \n"});
