Some options can also be set by --option=value, or --option value -- a list is shown by running meson setup --help.\nFor legacy reasons --warnlevel is the cli argument for the\nwarning_level option.\nThey can also be edited after setup using meson configure -Doption=value.\nInstallation options are usually relative to the prefix but it should\nnot be relied on, since they can be absolute paths in the following cases:\n\nWhen the prefix is /usr: sysconfdir defaults to /etc,\nlocalstatedir defaults to /var, and sharedstatedir defaults to\n/var/lib\n\nWhen the prefix is /usr/local: localstatedir defaults\nto /var/local, and sharedstatedir defaults to /var/local/lib\n\nWhen an absolute path outside of prefix is provided by the user/distributor.\n\n"});
