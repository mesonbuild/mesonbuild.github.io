This is especially convenient for e.g. distro\npackagers so they can easily generate unambiguous configuration files\nfor packge building.\nAs an example here's how you would generate a cross file that takes\nits settings from the CC, CXX, CFLAGS etc environment variables.\nThe command also has support for generating Debian build files using\nsystem introspection:\nNote how you don't need to specify any system details, the command\ngets them transparently via dpkg-architecture.\nCreating a native file is done in the same way:\nThis system will detect if the _FOR_BUILD environment variables are\nenabled and then uses them as needed.\nWith this you should be able to convert any envvar-based cross build\nsetup to cross and native files and then use those. This means, among\nother things, that you can then run your compilations from any shell,\nnot just the special one that has all the environment variables set.\nAs this functionality is still a bit in flux, the specific behaviour\nand command line arguments to use are subject to change. Because of\nthis the main documentation has not yet been updated.\nPlease try this for your use cases and report to us if it is working.\nPatches to make the autodetection work on other distros and platforms\nare also welcome.\n"});
