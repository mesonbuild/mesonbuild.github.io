fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Build-system-converters.html#page-description","fragment":"Moving from one build system into another includes a fair bit of\nwork. To make things easier, Meson provides scripts to convert other\nbuild systems into Meson. At the time of writing, scripts for CMake\nand autotools exist. It can be found in the tools subdirectory in\nMeson's source tree.\nThe scripts do not try to do a perfect conversion. This would be\nextremely difficult because the data models of other build systems are\nvery different. The goal of the converter script is to convert as much\nof the low level drudgery as possible. Using the scripts is\nstraightforward. We'll use the CMake one as an example but the\nAutotools one works exactly the same way.\nThis command generates a skeleton Meson project definition that tries\nto mirror CMake's setup as close as possible. Once this is done, you\nneed to go through these files manually and finalize the\nconversion. To make this task as simple as possible, the converter\nscript will transfer all comments from the CMake definition into Meson\ndefinition.\n"});
