Its usage is best demonstrated with an\nexample.\nHere we have an UI file created with Qt Designer and one source and\nheader file each that require preprocessing with the moc tool. We\nalso define a resource file to be compiled with rcc. We just have to\ntell Meson which files are which and it will take care of invoking all\nthe necessary tools in the correct order, which is done with the\npreprocess method of the qt5 module. Its output is simply put in\nthe list of sources for the target. The modules keyword of\ndependency works just like it does with Boost. It tells which\nsubparts of Qt the program uses.\nYou can set the main keyword argument to true to use the\nWinMain() function provided by qtmain static library (this argument\ndoes nothing on platforms other than Windows).\nSetting the optional private_headers keyword to true adds the\nprivate header include path of the given module(s) to the compiler\nflags. (since v0.47.0)\nNote using private headers in your project is a bad idea, do so at\nyour own risk.\nmethod may be auto, pkg-config or qmake.\n"});
