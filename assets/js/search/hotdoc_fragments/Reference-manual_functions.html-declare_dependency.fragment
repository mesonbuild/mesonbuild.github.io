fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#declare_dependency","fragment":"declare_dependency()\nThis function returns a dep object that\nbehaves like the return value of dependency() but is\ninternal to the current build. One use case for this is in\nsubprojects. This allows a subproject to easily specify how it should\nbe used. This makes it interchangeable with the same dependency that\nis provided externally by the system. Another common use case is to\ndeclare project targets as dependencies so they may be used as\ndependencies of other build targets.\n\n\n"});
