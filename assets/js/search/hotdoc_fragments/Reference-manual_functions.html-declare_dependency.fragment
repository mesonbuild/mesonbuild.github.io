fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#declare_dependency","fragment":"declare_dependency()\nThis function returns a dep object that\nbehaves like the return value of dependency() but is\ninternal to the current build. The main use case for this is in\nsubprojects. This allows a subproject to easily specify how it should\nbe used. This makes it interchangeable with the same dependency that\nis provided externally by the system.\n\n\n"});
