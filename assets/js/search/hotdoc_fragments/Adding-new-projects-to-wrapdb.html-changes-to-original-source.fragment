Most projects should not contain anything more\nthan a few Meson definition files. Sometimes it may be necessary to\nadd a template header file or something similar. These should be held\nat a minimum.\nIt should especially be noted that there must not be any patches\nto functionality. All such changes must be submitted to upstream. You\nmay also host your own Git repo with the changes if you wish. The Wrap\nsystem has native support for Git subprojects.\n"});
