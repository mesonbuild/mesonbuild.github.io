A JSON formatted result log can be\nfound in workspace/project/builddir/meson-logs/testlog.json.\nWhen these tests fail, the user probably wants to run the failing test\nin a debugger. To make this as integrated as possible, extract the\ntests from the intro-tests.json and intro-benchmarks.json files.\nThis provides you with all the information needed to run the test:\nwhat command to execute, command line arguments, environment variable\nsettings and how to process the output.\nThe depends entry (since 0.56.0) contains target ids; they can be\nlooked up in the targets introspection data. The executable pointed to\nby cmd is also included in the entry, as are any arguments to the\ntest that are build products.\n"});
