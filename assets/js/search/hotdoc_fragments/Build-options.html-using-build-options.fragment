For example, to get the installation prefix you would\nissue the following command:\nIt should be noted that you can not set option values in your Meson\nscripts. They have to be set externally with the meson configure\ncommand line tool. Running meson configure without arguments in a\nbuild dir shows you all options you can set.\nTo change their values use the -D\noption:\nSetting the value of arrays is a bit special. If you only pass a\nsingle string, then it is considered to have all values separated by\ncommas. Thus invoking the following command:\nwould set the value to an array of two elements, foo and bar.\nIf you need to have commas in your string values, then you need to\npass the value with proper shell quoting like this:\nThe inner values must always be single quotes and the outer ones\ndouble quotes.\nTo change values in subprojects prepend the name of the subproject and\na colon:\nNOTE: If you cannot call meson configure you likely have a old\nversion of Meson. In that case you can call mesonconf instead, but\nthat is deprecated in newer versions\n"});
