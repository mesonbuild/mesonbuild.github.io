For example to get the installation prefix you would issue the following command \nIt should be noted that you can not set option values in your Meson scripts. They have to be set externally with the meson configure command line tool. Running meson configure without arguments in a build dir shows you all options you can set. \nTo change their values use the D option \nSetting the value of arrays is a bit special. If you only pass a single string then it is considered to have all values separated by commas. Thus invoking the following command \nwould set the value to an array of two elements foo and bar. \nIf you need to have commas in your string values then you need to pass the value with proper shell quoting like this \nThe inner values must always be single quotes and the outer ones double quotes. \nTo change values in subprojects prepend the name of the subproject and a colon \nNOTE If you cannot call meson configure you likely have a old version of Meson. In that case you can call mesonconf instead but that is deprecated in newer versions \n"});
