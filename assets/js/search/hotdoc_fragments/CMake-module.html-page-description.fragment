fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"CMake-module.html#page-description","fragment":"Note: the functionality of this module is governed by Meson's\nrules on mixing build systems.\nThis module provides helper tools for generating cmake package files.\nIt also supports the usage of CMake based subprojects, similar to\nthe normal Meson subprojects.\nTo use this module, just do: cmake = import('cmake'). The\nfollowing functions will then be available as methods on the object\nwith the name cmake. You can, of course, replace the name cmake\nwith anything else.\nIt is generally recommended to use the latest Meson version and\nCMake >=3.17 for best compatibility. CMake subprojects will\nusually also work with older CMake versions. However, this can\nlead to unexpected issues in rare cases.\nUsing CMake subprojects is similar to using the \"normal\" Meson\nsubprojects. They also have to be located in the subprojects\ndirectory.\nExample:\nThe subproject method is almost identical to the normal Meson\nsubproject function. The only difference is that a CMake project\ninstead of a Meson project is configured.\nThe returned sub_proj supports the same options as a \"normal\"\nsubproject. Meson automatically detects CMake build targets, which can\nbe accessed with the methods listed below.\nIt is usually enough to just use the dependency object returned by the\ndependency() method in the build targets. This is almost identical\nto using declare_dependency() object from a normal Meson subproject.\nIt is also possible to use executables defined in the CMake project as code\ngenerators with the target() method:\nIt should be noted that not all projects are guaranteed to work. The\nsafest approach would still be to create a meson.build for the\nsubprojects in question.\nNew in meson 0.55.0\nMeson also supports passing configuration options to CMake and overriding\ncertain build details extracted from the CMake subproject.\nSee the CMake options object for a complete\nreference of all supported functions.\nThe CMake configuration options object is very similar to the\nconfiguration data\nobject object returned\nby configuration_data. It\nis generated by the subproject_options function\nAll configuration options have to be set before the subproject is\nconfigured and must be passed to the subproject method via the\noptions key. Altering the configuration object won't have any effect\non previous cmake.subproject calls.\nIn earlier Meson versions CMake command-line parameters could be set\nwith the cmake_options kwarg. However, this feature is deprecated\nsince 0.55.0 and only kept for compatibility. It will not work\ntogether with the options kwarg.\nThis object is returned by the subproject function described above\nand supports the following methods:\nThis object is returned by the subproject_options() function and\nconsumed by the options kwarg of the subproject function. The\nfollowing methods are supported:\nThe methods set_override_option, set_install,\nappend_compile_args and append_link_args support the optional\ntarget kwarg. If specified, the set options affect the specific\ntarget. The effect of the option is global for the subproject\notherwise.\nIf, for instance, opt_var.set_install(false) is called, no target\nwill be installed regardless of what is set by CMake. However, it is\nstill possible to install specific targets (here foo) by setting the\ntarget kwarg: opt_var.set_install(true, target: 'foo')\nOptions that are not set won't affect the generated subproject. So, if\nfor instance, set_install was not called then the values extracted\nfrom CMake will be used.\nNew in 0.56.0\nMeson will try to automatically guess most of the required CMake\ntoolchain variables from existing entries in the cross and native\nfiles. These variables will be stored in an automatically generate\nCMake toolchain file in the build directory. The remaining variables\nthat can't be guessed can be added by the user in the [cmake]\ncross/native file section (new in 0.56.0).\nAdding a manual CMake toolchain file is also supported with the\ncmake_toolchain_file setting in the [properties] section. Directly\nsetting a CMake toolchain file with\n-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/some/Toolchain.cmake in the\nmeson.build is not supported since the automatically generated\ntoolchain file is also used by Meson to inject arbitrary code into\nCMake to enable the CMake subproject support.\nThe closest configuration to only using a manual CMake toolchain file\nwould be to set these options in the machine file:\nThis will result in a toolchain file with just the bare minimum to\nenable the CMake subproject support and include() the\ncmake_toolchain_file as the last instruction.\nFor more information see the cross and native file\nspecification.\nThis function is the equivalent of the corresponding CMake\nfunction,\nit generates a name package version file.\nExample:\nThis function is the equivalent of the corresponding CMake\nfunction,\nit generates a name package configuration file from the input\ntemplate file. Just like the cmake function in this file the\n@PACKAGE_INIT@ statement will be replaced by the appropriate piece\nof cmake code. The equivalent PATH_VARS argument is given through\nthe configuration parameter.\nExample:\nmeson.build:\nmyProject.cmake.in:\n\n\ndependency(target) returns a dependency object for any CMake target. The\ninclude_type kwarg (new in 0.56.0) controls the include type of the\nreturned dependency object similar to the same kwarg in the\ndependency() function.\n\ninclude_directories(target) returns a Meson include_directories()\nobject for the specified target. Using this function is not necessary\nif the dependency object is used.\n\ntarget(target) returns the raw build target.\n\ntarget_type(target) returns the type of the target as a string\n\ntarget_list() returns a list of all target names.\n\nget_variable(name) fetches the specified variable from inside\nthe subproject. Usually dependency() or target() should be\npreferred to extract build targets.\n\nfound returns true if the subproject is available, otherwise false\nnew in Meson 0.53.2\n\n\n\n\nadd_cmake_defines({'opt1': val1, ...}) add additional CMake commandline defines\n\nset_override_option(opt, val) set specific build options\nfor targets. This will effectively add opt=val to the override_options\narray of the build target\n\n\nset_install(bool) override wether targets should be installed or not\n\nappend_compile_args(lang, arg1, ...) append compile flags for a specific\nlanguage to the targets\n\nappend_link_args(arg1, ...) append linger args to the targets\n\nclear() reset all data in the cmake options object\n\n\n\nname: the name of the package.\n\nversion: the version of the generated package file.\n\ncompatibility: a string indicating the kind of compatibility, the accepted values are\nAnyNewerVersion, SameMajorVersion, SameMinorVersion or ExactVersion.\nIt defaults to AnyNewerVersion. Depending on your cmake installation some kind of\ncompatibility may not be available.\n\ninstall_dir: optional installation directory, it defaults to $(libdir)/cmake/$(name)\n\n\n\n\nname: the name of the package.\n\ninput: the template file where that will be treated for variable substitutions contained in configuration.\n\ninstall_dir: optional installation directory, it defaults to $(libdir)/cmake/$(name).\n\nconfiguration: a configuration_data object that will be used for variable substitution in the template file.\n\n"});
