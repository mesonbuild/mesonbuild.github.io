This way one can just use it without even looking inside build\ndefinitions of that subproject.\nIn cases where there are multiple dependencies need to be declared,\nthe default one should be named as <project_name>_dep (e.g.\ngtest_dep), and others can have <project_name>_<other>_<name>_dep\nform (e.g. gtest_main_dep - gtest with main function).\nThere may be exceptions to these rules where common sense should be applied.\n"});
