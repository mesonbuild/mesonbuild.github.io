fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"SourceSet-module.html#add","fragment":"add()\nAdd a rule to a source set. A rule determines the conditions under\nwhich some source files or dependency objects are included in a build\nconfiguration. All source files must be present in the source tree or\nthey can be created in the build tree via configure_file,\ncustom_target or generator.\nvarnames_and_deps is a list of conditions for the rule, which can be\neither strings or dependency objects (a dependency object is anything\nthat has a found() method). If all the strings evaluate to true\nand all dependencies are found, the rule will evaluate to true;\napply() will then include the contents of the if_true keyword\nargument in its result. Otherwise, that is if any of the strings in\nthe positional arguments evaluate to false or any dependency is not\nfound, apply() will instead use the contents of the if_false\nkeyword argument.\nDependencies can also appear in sources_and_deps. In this case, a\nmissing dependency will simply be ignored and will not disable the\nrule, similar to how the dependencies keyword argument works in\nbuild targets.\nNote: It is generally better to avoid mixing source sets and\ndisablers. This is because disablers will cause the rule to be dropped\naltogether, and the list_of_alt_sources would not be taken into\naccount anymore.\n"});
