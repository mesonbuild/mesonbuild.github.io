See dependency() for\nargument format. The version of the program is determined by running\nprogram_name --version command. If stdout is empty it fallbacks to\nstderr. If the output contains more text than simply a version number,\nonly the first occurrence of numbers separated by dots is kept. If the\noutput is more complicated than that, the version checking will have\nto be done manually using run_command().\n"});
