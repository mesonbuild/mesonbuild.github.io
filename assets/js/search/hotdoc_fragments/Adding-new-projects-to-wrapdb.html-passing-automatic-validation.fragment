Therefore it is highly\nrecommended that you run the validation checks yourself so you can fix\nany issues faster.\nYou can test the wrap itself with the following commands:\nThe first command is to ensure the wrap is correctly fetched from the\nlatest packagefiles. The second command configures meson and selects a\nset of subprojects to enable.\nThe Github project contains automatic CI on pushing to run the project\nand check the metadata for obvious mistakes. This can be checked from\nyour fork before submitting a PR.\n"});
