This directory can be overridden by specifying it with\nthe install_dir keyword argument. If you just want to install into a\nsubdirectory of the system header directory, then use the subdir\nargument. As an example if this has the value myproj then the\nheaders would be installed to /{prefix}/include/myproj.\nPlease note that this can only install static files from the source tree.\nGenerated files are installed via the install_dir: kwarg on the respective\ngenerators, such as custom_target() or `configure_file().\n\n\n"});
