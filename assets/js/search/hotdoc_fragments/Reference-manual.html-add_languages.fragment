fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual.html#add_languages","fragment":"add_languages()\nAdd programming languages used by the project. Equivalent to having\nthem in the project declaration. This function is usually used to\nadd languages that are only used under some conditions, like this:\nTakes the following keyword arguments:\nrequired: defaults to true, which means that if any of the languages\nspecified is not found, Meson will halt. (since 0.47.0) The value of a\nfeature option can also be passed.\nnative (since 0.54.0): if set to true, the language will be used to compile for the build\nmachine, if false, for the host machine.\nReturns true if all languages specified were found and false otherwise.\nIf native is omitted, the languages may be used for either build or host\nmachine, but are never required for the build machine.  (i.e. it is equivalent\nto add_languages(*langs*, native: false, required: *required*) and add_languages(*langs*, native: true, required: false). This default behaviour\nmay change to native: false in a future Meson version.\n\n\nrequired: defaults to true, which means that if any of the languages\nspecified is not found, Meson will halt. (since 0.47.0) The value of a\nfeature option can also be passed.\n\n\nnative (since 0.54.0): if set to true, the language will be used to compile for the build\nmachine, if false, for the host machine.\n\n\n"});
