In fact, writing a text editor is a lot more complicated and\ntakes more effort. Yet we have lots of very high quality editors but\nonly few build systems with questionable quality and usability.\nSo, in the grand tradition of own-itch-scratching, I decided to run a\nscientific experiment. The purpose of this experiment was to explore\nwhat would it take to build a \"good\" build system. What kind of syntax\nwould suit this problem? What sort of problems would this application\nneed to solve? What sort of solutions would be the most appropriate?\nTo get things started, here is a list of requirements any modern\ncross-platform build system needs to provide.\n"});
