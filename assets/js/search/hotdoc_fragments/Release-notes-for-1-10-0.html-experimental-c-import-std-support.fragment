This support is enabled with the new cpp_importstd\noption. It defaults to false, but you can set it to true either\nglobally or per-target using override_options in the usual way.\nThe implementation has many limitations. The biggest one is that the\nsame module file is used on all targets. That means you can not mix\nmultiple different C++ standards versions as the compiled module file\ncan only be used with the same compiler options as were used to build\nit. This feature only works with the Ninja backend.\nAs import std is a major new feature in compilers, expect to\nencounter toolchain issues when using it. For an example see\nhere.\n"});
