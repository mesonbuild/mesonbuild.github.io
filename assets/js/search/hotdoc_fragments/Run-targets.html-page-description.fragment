As an example you might have a build target that reformats\nyour source code, runs cppcheck or something similar. In Meson this\nis accomplished with a so called run target.\nThe recommended way of doing this is writing the command(s) you want\nto run to a script file. Here's an example script.\nNote the two environment variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT and\nMESON_BUILD_ROOT. These are absolute paths to your project's source\nand build directories and they are automatically set up by Meson. In\naddition to these Meson also sets up the variable MESON_SUBDIR,\nwhich points to the subdirectory where the run command was specified.\nMost commands don't need to set up this.\nNote how the script starts by cd'ing into the source dir. Meson does\nnot guarantee that the script is run in any specific directory.\nWhether you need to do the same depends on what your custom target\nwants to do.\nTo make this a run target we write it to a script file called\nscripts/inspect.sh and specify it in the top level Meson file like\nthis.\nRun targets are not run by default. To run it run the following command.\nAll additional entries in run_target's command array are passed\nunchanged to the inspector script, so you can do things like this:\n"});
