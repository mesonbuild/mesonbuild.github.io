fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Run-targets.html#page-description", "fragment": "Sometimes you need to have a target that just runs an external command. As an example you might have a build target that reformats your source code runs cppcheck or something similar. In Meson this is accomplished with a so called run target. \nThe recommended way of doing this is writing the command s you want to run to a script file. Here s an example script. \nNote the two environment variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT and MESON_BUILD_ROOT. These are absolute paths to your project s source and build directories and they are automatically set up by Meson. In addition to these Meson also sets up the variable MESON_SUBDIR which points to the subdirectory where the run command was specified. Most commands don t need to set up this. \nNote how the script starts by cd ing into the source dir. Meson does not guarantee that the script is run in any specific directory. Whether you need to do the same depends on what your custom target wants to do. \nTo make this a run target we write it to a script file called scripts inspect.sh and specify it in the top level Meson file like this. \nRun targets are not run by default. To run it run the following command. \nAll additional entries in run_target s command array are passed unchanged to the inspector script so you can do things like this \n"});
