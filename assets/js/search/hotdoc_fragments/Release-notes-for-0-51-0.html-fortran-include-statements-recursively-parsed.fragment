Since v0.51,\nMeson can handle Fortran include directives recursively.\nDO NOT list include files as sources for a target, as in general\ntheir syntax is not correct as a standalone target. In general\ninclude files are meant to be injected inline as if they were copy\nand pasted into the source file.\ninclude was never standard and was superceded by Fortran 90 module.\nThe include file is only recognized by Meson if it has a Fortran\nfile suffix, such as .f .F .f90 .F90 or similar. This is to\navoid deeply nested scanning of large external legacy C libraries that\nonly interface to Fortran by include biglib.h or similar.\n"});
