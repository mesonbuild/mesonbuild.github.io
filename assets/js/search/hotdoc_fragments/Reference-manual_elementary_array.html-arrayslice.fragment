fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_elementary_array.html#arrayslice","fragment":"array.slice()\nReturn a selection of the elements of the array starting at index start\nand continuing with step size jumps until stop. Negative indices count\nfrom the back of the array. The step size cannot be zero, but may be\nnegative. If it is negative, start and stop default to the end and\nbeginning of the array, respectively. If step is positive, start\ndefaults to 0 and stop defaults to the length of the array. Either both\nor none of start and stop must be provided to prevent ambiguity.\n\n\n"});
