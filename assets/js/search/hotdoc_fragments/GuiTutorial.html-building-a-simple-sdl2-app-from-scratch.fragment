The document is written for\nWindows, as it is the most complex platform, but the same basic ideas\nshould work on Linux and macOS as well.\nThe sample application is written in plain C as SDL 2 is also written\nin C. If you prefer C++ instead, the conversion is fairly simple and\nis left as an exercise to the reader.\nThis document assumes that you have already installed both Visual\nStudio and Meson.\n"});
