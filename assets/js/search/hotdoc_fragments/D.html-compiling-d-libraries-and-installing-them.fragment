You should generate a pkg-config\nfile and install it, in order to make other software on the system\nfind the dependency once it is installed.\nThis is an example on how to build a D shared library:\nIt is important to make the D sources install in a subdirectory in the\ninclude path, in this case /usr/include/d/mylib/mylib. All D\ncompilers include the /usr/include/d directory by default, and if\nyour library would be installed into /usr/include/d/mylib, there is\na high chance that, when you compile your project again on a machine\nwhere you installed it, the compiler will prefer the old installed\ninclude over the new version in the source tree, leading to very\nconfusing errors.\nThis is an example of how to use the D library we just built and\ninstalled in an application:\nPlease keep in mind that the library and executable would both need to\nbe built with the exact same D compiler and D compiler version. The D\nABI is not stable across compilers and their versions, and mixing\ncompilers will lead to problems.\n"});
