The first thing you need to do is to install the\nnewest version of Python 3 from the project's web\nsite.\n\nOnce you have a working Python you can install the necessary bits\nusing Python's Pip package manager.\nThis will install the necessary files in your home directory, but\nsadly they are not directly usable. You need to add the directory they\nare written to in the system's PATH environment variable so the\nprograms can be used directly from the terminal. This requires editing\na text configuration file.\nThe correct file to edit depends on which shell you are currently\nusing. If you have an old macOS install it is probably Bash and the\nfile you need to edit is .bash_profile. If, on the other hand, you\nhave a new macOS install then you are probably using Zsh and the file\nto edit is .zshrc. In either case the file should be in your home\ndirectory.\nFor Bash the line you need to add is this:\nwhereas for Zsh it is this:\nIn both case you need to change the values for username and 3.9.\nThe former needs to be substituted with your Unix username while the\nlatter needs to contain the actual Python version you installed.\nOnce this is done close the terminal application and start it again.\nNow you should be able to run the meson command.\n\n"});
