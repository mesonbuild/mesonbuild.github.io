fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Creating-Linux-binaries.html#page-description", "fragment": "Creating Linux binaries that can be downloaded and run on any distro like dmg packages for OSX or exe installers for Windows has traditionally been difficult. This is even more tricky if you want to use modern compilers and features which is especially desired in game development. There is still no simple turn key solution for this problem but with a bit of setup it can be relatively straightforward. \nFirst you need to do a fresh operating system install. You can use spare hardware VirtualBox cloud or whatever you want. Note that the distro you install must be at least as old as the oldest release you wish to support. Debian stable is usually a good choice though immediately after its release you might want to use Debian oldstable or the previous Ubuntu LTS. The oldest supported version of CentOS is also a good choice. \nOnce you have installed the system you need to install build dependencies for GCC. In Debian based distros this can be done with the following commands \nThen create a src subdirectory in your home directory. Copy paste the following into install_gcc.sh and execute it. \nThen finally add the following lines to your bashrc. \nLog out and back in and now your build environment is ready to use. \nOld distros might have too old versions of some tools. For Meson this could include Python and Ninja. If this is the case you need to download build and install new versions into devroot in the usual way. \nYou want to embed and statically link every dependency you can especially C dependencies Meson s Wrap package manager might be of use here. This is equivalent to what you would do on Windows OSX Android etc. Sometimes static linking is not possible. In these cases you need to copy the so files inside your package. Let s use SDL2 as an example. First we download and install it as usual giving it our custom install prefix that is configure prefix HOME devroot This makes Meson s dependency detector pick it up automatically. \nBuilding happens in much the same way as normally. There are just two things to note. First you must tell GCC to link the C standard library statically. If you don t then your app is guaranteed to break as different distros have binary incompatible C libraries. The second thing is that you need to point your install prefix to some empty staging area. Here s the meson command to do that \nThe aim is to put the executable in tmp myapp bin and shared libraries to tmp myapp lib. The next thing you need is the embedder. It takes your dependencies in this case only libSDL2 so.0 and copies them in the lib directory. Depending on your use case you can either copy the files by hand or write a script that parses the output of ldd binary_file. Be sure not to copy system libraries libc libpthread libm etc For an example see the sample project. \nMake the script run during install with this \nIf you try to run the program now it will most likely fail to start or crashes. The reason for this is that the system does not know that the executable needs libraries from the lib directory. The solution for this is a simple wrapper script. Create a script called myapp.sh with the following content \nInstall it with this Meson snippet \nAnd now you are done. Zip up your tmp myapp directory and you have a working binary ready for deployment. To run the program just unzip the file and run myapp.sh. \n"});
