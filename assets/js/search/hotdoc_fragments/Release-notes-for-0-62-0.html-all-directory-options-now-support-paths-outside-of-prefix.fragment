It is also useful for platforms like Nix, which install projects into\nmultiple independent prefixes.\nAs a consequence, get_option might return absolute paths for any\ndirectory option, if a directory outside of prefix is passed. This\nis technically a backwards incompatible change but its effect\nshould be minimal, thanks to widespread use of join_paths/\n/ operator and pkg-config generator module.\n"});
