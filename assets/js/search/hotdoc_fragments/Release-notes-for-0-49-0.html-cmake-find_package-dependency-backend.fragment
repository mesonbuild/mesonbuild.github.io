Both the old-style <NAME>_LIBRARIES variables as well\nas imported targets are supported. Meson can automatically guess the\ncorrect CMake target in most cases but it is also possible to manually\nspecify a target with the modules property.\nCMake is automatically used after pkg-config fails when\nno method (or auto) was provided in the dependency options.\n"});
