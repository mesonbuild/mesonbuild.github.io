The Autotools \"dist\"\ntarget packages up the current source tree. Meson packages the latest\nrevision control commit. The reason for this is that it prevents\ndevelopers from doing accidental releases where the distributed\narchive does not match any commit in revision control (especially the\none tagged for the release).\n"});
