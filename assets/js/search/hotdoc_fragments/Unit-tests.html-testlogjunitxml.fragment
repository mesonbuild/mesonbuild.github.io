It is not\nstreamed out, and is written only once all tests complete running.\nWhen tests use the tap protocol each test will be recorded as a\ntestsuite container, with each case named by the number of the result.\nWhen tests use the gtest protocol Meson will inject arguments to the\ntest to generate its own JUnit XML, which Meson will include as part\nof this XML file.\nNew in 0.55.0\n"});
