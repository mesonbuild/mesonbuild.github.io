You can read about\nit in the Contributing documentation\nWe are also willing to support old versions of meson as LTS releases,\nparticularly, if it is the final version to support a given python version. If\nyou have a use case, please discuss it with us and be willing to help backport\nbug fixes.\nWe encourage projects to support a wide range of Meson versions if they are not\nactually using the latest features anyway. In many, many cases it is quite\npractical to support e.g. Meson 0.61.\n\npython 3.5: supported through Meson 0.56.2\n\npython 3.6: supported through Meson 0.61.5\n\npython 3.7: currently actively supported by Meson\n\n"});
