By\ndefault, it will take all recognizable source files in the current\ndirectory. You can also specify a list of dependencies with the -d\nflag and automatically invoke a build with the -b flag to check if the\ncode builds with those dependencies.\nFor example,\nwill look for C or C++ files in the current directory, generate a\nmeson.build for them with the dependencies of sdl2 and gl and\nimmediately try to build it, overwriting any previous meson.build and\nbuild directory.\n"});
