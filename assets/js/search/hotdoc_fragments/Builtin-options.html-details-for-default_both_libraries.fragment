Note that, unlike\ndefault_library, this option does not affect how the library artifacts are\nbuilt, but how they are internally linked to the dependent targets within the\nsame project.\nThe possible values of this option are 'shared' (default value, compatible with\nprevious meson versions), 'static', and 'auto'. With auto, the value from the\ndefault_library option is used, unless it is 'both', in which case 'shared' is\nused instead.\nWhen default_both_libraries is 'auto', passing a both_libs dependency\nin both_libraries() will link the static dependency with the static lib,\nand the shared dependency with the shared lib.\n"});
