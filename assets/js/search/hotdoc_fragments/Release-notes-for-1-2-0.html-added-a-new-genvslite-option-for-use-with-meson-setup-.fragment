E.g. 'somebuilddir_debug',\n'somebuilddir_release', etc. as well as a '_vs'-suffixed directory that contains the\ngenerated multi-buildtype solution.  Building/cleaning/rebuilding in the solution\nnow launches the meson build (compile) of the corresponding buildtype-suffixed build\ndirectory, instead of using Visual Studio's native engine.\n"});
