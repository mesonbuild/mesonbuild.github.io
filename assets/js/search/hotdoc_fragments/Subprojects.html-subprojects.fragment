In these\ncases it is common to bundle all third party libraries in your source\ntree. This is usually frowned upon because it makes it hard to add\nthese kinds of projects into e.g. those Linux distributions that\nforbid bundled libraries.\nMeson tries to solve this problem by making it extremely easy to\nprovide both at the same time. The way this is done is that Meson\nallows you to take any other Meson project and make it a part of your\nbuild without (in the best case) any changes to its Meson setup. It\nbecomes a transparent part of the project.\nIt should be noted that this is only guaranteed to work for subprojects\nthat are built with Meson. The reason is the simple fact that there is\nno possible way to do this reliably with mixed build systems. Because of\nthis, only Meson subprojects are described here.\nCMake based subprojects are also\nsupported but not guaranteed to work.\n"});
