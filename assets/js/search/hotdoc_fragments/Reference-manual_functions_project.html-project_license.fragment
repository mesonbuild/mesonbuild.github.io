fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions_project.html#project_license","fragment":"Takes a string or array of strings describing the license(s) the code is under.\nThis should be an SPDX license expression,\nusing the standardized license identifier from the SPDX license\nlist.  Usually this would be something like\nlicense : 'GPL-2.0-or-later'. If there are multiple licenses you can use the\nAND and OR operators to join them: license : 'Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0'.\nFor backwards compatibility reasons you can also pass an array of\nlicenses here. This is not recommended, as it is ambiguous: license : ['Apache-2.0', 'GPL-2.0-only'] instead use an SPDX expression: license : 'Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-only', which makes it clear that the license\nmean OR, not AND.\nNote that the text is informal and is only written to the dependency\nmanifest. Meson does not do any license validation, you are responsible\nfor verifying that you abide by all licensing terms. You can access the\nvalue in your Meson build files with meson.project_license().\n"});
