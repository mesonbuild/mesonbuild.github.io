fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Release-notes-for-0-63-0.html#python-extension-modules-now-depend-on-the-python-library-by-default","fragment":"Python extension modules now depend on the python library by default\nPython extension modules are usually expected to link to the python library\nand/or its headers in order to build correctly (via the default embed: false,\nwhich may not actually link to the library itself). This means that every\nsingle use of .extension_module() needed to include the dependencies: py_installation.dependency() kwarg explicitly.\nIn the interest of doing the right thing out of the box, this is now the\ndefault for extension modules that don't already include a dependency on\npython. This is not expected to break anything, because it should always be\nneeded. Nevertheless, py_installation.dependency().partial_dependency() will\nbe detected as already included while providing no compile/link args.\n"});
