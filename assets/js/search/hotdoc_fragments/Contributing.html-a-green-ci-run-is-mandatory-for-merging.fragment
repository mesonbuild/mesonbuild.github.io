It\ndoes not matter why CI fails, it is a hard blocker. Even if the MR\ncould possibly not have anything to do with the failure and clearly\nshould be permitted, it may not be merged. Only MRs that fix the CI\nissue are allowed to land in trunk.\nThere is one, and only one, exception to this. At the time of writing\nthe Apple CI is unreliable and sometimes fails with clock skew errors.\nIf a merge causes CI failure any developer can revert it out of\nmaster. It is then the responsibility of the original submitter to\nresubmit a fixed version.\n"});
