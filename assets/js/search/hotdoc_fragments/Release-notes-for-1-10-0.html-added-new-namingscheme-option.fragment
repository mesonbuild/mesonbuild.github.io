This has meant, among other things, that on Windows\nMeson uses a nonstandard .a suffix for static libraries because both\nstatic libraries and import libraries have the suffix .lib.\nThere is now an option namingscheme that can be set to\nplatform. This new platform native naming scheme that replicates\nwhat Rust does. That is, shared libraries on Windows get a suffix\n.dll, static libraries get .lib and import libraries have the name\n.dll.lib.\nWe expect to change the default value of this option to platform in\na future major version. Until that happens we reserve the right to\nalter how platform actually names its output files.\n"});
