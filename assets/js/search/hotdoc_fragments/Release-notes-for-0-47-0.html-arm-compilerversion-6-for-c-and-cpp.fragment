The required ARMCLANG compiler options for\nbuilding a shareable library are not included in the current Meson\nimplementation for ARMCLANG support, so it can not build shareable\nlibraries. This current Meson implementation for ARMCLANG support can\nnot build assembly files with arm syntax (we need to use armasm\ninstead of ARMCLANG for the .s files with this syntax) and only\nsupports GNU syntax.\nThe default extension of the executable output is .axf. The\nenvironment path should be set properly for the ARM compiler\nexecutables. The --target, -mcpu options with the appropriate\nvalues should be mentioned in the cross file as shown in the snippet\nbelow.\nNote:\n\nThe current changes are tested on Windows only.\nPIC support is not enabled by default for ARM,\nif users want to use it, they need to add the required arguments\nexplicitly from cross-file(c_args/cpp_args) or some other way.\n\n"});
