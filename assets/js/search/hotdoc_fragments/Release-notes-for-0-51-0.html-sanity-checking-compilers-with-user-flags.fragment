This usually involves building\nsimple executable and trying to run it. Previously user flags\n(compilation and/or linking flags) were used for sanity checking cross\ncompilers, but not native compilers. This is because such flags might\nbe essential for a cross binary to succeed, but usually aren't for a\nnative compiler.\nIn recent releases, there has been an effort to minimize the\nspecial-casing of cross or native builds so as to make building more\npredictable in less-tested cases. Since this the user flags are\nnecessary for cross, but not harmful for native, it makes more sense\nto use them in all sanity checks than use them in no sanity checks, so\nthis is what we now do.\n"});
