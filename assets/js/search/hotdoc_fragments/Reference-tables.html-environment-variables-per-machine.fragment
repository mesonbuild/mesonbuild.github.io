fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-tables.html#environment-variables-per-machine","fragment":"Environment variables per machine\nSince 0.54.0, Following Autotool and other legacy build systems,\nenvironment variables that affect machine-specific settings come in\npairs: for every bare environment variable FOO, there is a suffixed\nFOO_FOR_BUILD, where FOO just affects the host machine\nconfiguration, while FOO_FOR_BUILD just affects the build machine\nconfiguration. For example:\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH_FOR_BUILD controls the paths pkg-config will search for\njust native: true dependencies (build machine).\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH controls the paths pkg-config will search for just\nnative: false dependencies (host machine).\nThis mirrors the build. prefix used for (built-in) Meson options,\nwhich has the same meaning.\nThis is useful for cross builds. In the native builds, build = host,\nand the unsuffixed environment variables alone will suffice.\nPrior to 0.54.0, there was no _FOR_BUILD-suffixed variables, and\nmost environment variables only effected native machine\nconfigurations, though this wasn't consistent (e.g. PKG_CONFIG_PATH\nstill affected cross builds).\n\n\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH_FOR_BUILD controls the paths pkg-config will search for\njust native: true dependencies (build machine).\n\n\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH controls the paths pkg-config will search for just\nnative: false dependencies (host machine).\n\n\n"});
