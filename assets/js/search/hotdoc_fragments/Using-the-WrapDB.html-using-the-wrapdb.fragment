Using it is simple. The service can be found here. \nThe front page lists all projects that are on the service. Select the one you want and click it. The detail page lists available versions by branch and revision id. The branch names come from upstream releases and revision ids are version numbers internal to the database. Whenever the packaging is updated a new revision is released to the service a new revision with a bigger revision id is added. Usually you want to select the newest branch with the highest revision id. \nYou can get the actual wrap file which tells Meson how to fetch the project by clicking on the download link on the page. As an example the wrap file for zlib revision looks like this. You can find detailed documentation about it in the Wrap manual. \nAdd this file to your project with the name subprojects zlib.wrap. Then you can use it in your meson.build file with this directive \nWhen Meson encounters this it will automatically download unpack and patch the source files. \n"});
