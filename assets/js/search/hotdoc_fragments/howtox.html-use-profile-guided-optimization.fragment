First we set up the project with profile measurements\nenabled and compile it.\nThen we need to run the program with some representative input. This\nstep depends on your project.\nOnce that is done we change the compiler flags to use the generated\ninformation and rebuild.\nAfter these steps the resulting binary is fully optimized.\n"});
