However, they cannot be shown in\nthe output of meson --help because they depend on both the current\nplatform and the compiler that will be selected. The only way to see\nthem is to setup a builddir and then run meson configure on it with\nno options.\nThe following options are available. Note that they may not be\navailable on all platforms or with all compilers:\nThe value of b_sanitize can be one of: none, address, thread,\nundefined, memory, address,undefined, but note that some\ncompilers might not support all of them. For example Visual Studio\nonly supports the address sanitizer.\nLLVM supports thin lto, for more discussion see LLVM's documentation\n\nThe default value of b_vscrt is from_buildtype. The following table is\nused internally to pick the CRT compiler arguments for from_buildtype or\nstatic_from_buildtype (since 0.56) based on the value of the buildtype\noption:\n\n< 0 means disable, == 0 means automatic selection, > 0 sets a specific number to use\n\n\n\n\n Option\n Default value\n Possible values\n Description\n\n\n\n\n b_asneeded\n true\n true, false\n Use -Wl,--as-needed when linking\n\n\n b_bitcode\n false\n true, false\n Embed Apple bitcode, see below\n\n\n b_colorout\n always\n auto, always, never\n Use colored output\n\n\n b_coverage\n false\n true, false\n Enable coverage tracking\n\n\n b_lundef\n true\n true, false\n Don't allow undefined symbols when linking\n\n\n b_lto\n false\n true, false\n Use link time optimization\n\n\n b_lto_threads\n 0\n Any integer*\n Use multiple threads for lto.
