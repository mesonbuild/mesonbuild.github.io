However since it is written to\ne.g. the dependency manifest is usually makes sense to have it be the\nsame as the project tarball or pkg-config name. So for example you\nwould probably want to use the name libfoobar instead of The Foobar\nLibrary.\nIt may be followed by the array of programming languages that the project uses.\n(since 0.40.0) The array of languages is optional.\nThese languages may be used both for native: false (the default)\n(host machine) targets and for native: true (build machine) targets.\n(since 0.56.0) The build machine compilers for the specified\nlanguages are not required.\nSupported values for languages are c, cpp (for C++), cuda,\ncython, d, objc, objcpp, fortran, java, cs (for C#),\nswift, nasm, masm, linearasm, vala and rust.\n\n\n"});
