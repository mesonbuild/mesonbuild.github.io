This can be done by\nspecifying install_dir as an array rather than a single string. The\narray must have as many items as there are outputs and each entry\nspecifies how the corresponding output file should be installed. For\nexample:\nIn this case file1 would be installed to /prefix/path1/file1,\nfile2 would not be installed at all and file3 would be installed\nto `/prefix/path3/file3'.\n"});
