fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Shipping-prebuilt-binaries-as-wraps.html#page-description","fragment":"A common dependency case, especially on Windows, is the need to\nprovide dependencies as prebuilt binaries rather than Meson projects\nthat you build from scratch. Common reasons include not having access\nto source code, not having the time and effort to rewrite a legacy\nsystem's build definitions to Meson or just the fact that compiling\nthe dependency projects takes too long.\nPackaging a project is straightforward. As an example let's look at a\ncase where the project consists of one static library called bob and\nsome headers. To create a binary dependency project we put the static\nlibrary at the top level and headers in a subdirectory called\ninclude. The Meson build definition would look like the following.\nNow you can use this subproject as if it was a Meson project:\nNote that often libraries compiled with different compilers (or even\ncompiler flags) might not be compatible. If you do this, then you are\nresponsible for verifying that your libraries are compatible, Meson\nwill not check things for you.\n"});
