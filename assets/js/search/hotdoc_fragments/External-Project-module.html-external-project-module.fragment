fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"External-Project-module.html#external-project-module","fragment":"External Project module\nNote: the functionality of this module is governed by Meson's\nrules on mixing build systems.\nThis is an experimental module, API could change.\nThis module allows building code that uses build systems other than\nMeson. This module is intended to be used to build Autotools\nsubprojects as fallback if the dependency couldn't be found on the\nsystem (e.g. too old distro version).\nThe project will be compiled out-of-tree inside Meson's build\ndirectory. The project will also be installed inside Meson's build\ndirectory using make's\nDESTDIR\nfeature. During project installation step, that DESTDIR will be copied\nverbatim into the desired location.\nExternal subprojects can use libraries built by Meson (main project,\nor other subprojects) using pkg-config, thanks to *-uninstalled.pc\nfiles generated by pkg.generate().\nExternal build system requirements:\nKnown limitations:\nAdded 0.56.0\n\nMust support out-of-tree build. The configure script will be invoked with the\ncurrent workdir inside Meson's build directory and not subproject's top source\ndirectory.\nConfigure script must generate a Makefile in the current workdir.\nConfigure script must take common directories like prefix, libdir, etc, as\ncommand line arguments.\nConfigure script must support common environment variable like CFLAGS, CC, etc.\nCompilation step must detect when a reconfigure is needed, and do it\ntransparently.\n\n\nExecutables from external projects cannot be used uninstalled, because they\nwould need its libraries to be installed in the final location. This is why\nthere is no find_program() method.\nThe configure script must generate a Makefile, other build systems are not\nyet supported.\nWhen cross compiling, if PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR is set in environment or\nsys_root in the cross file properties, the external subproject will not be\nable to find dependencies built by Meson using pkg-config. The reason is\npkg-config and pkgconf both prepend the sysroot path to -I and -L arguments\nfrom -uninstalled.pc files. This is arguably a bug that could be fixed in\nfuture version of pkg-config/pkgconf.\n\n"});
