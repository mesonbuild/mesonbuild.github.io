This is most common when building rpm or deb\npackages. This is done with the DESTDIR environment variable and it\nis used just like with other build systems:\nSince 0.57.0 --destdir argument can be used instead of environment. In that\ncase Meson will set DESTDIR into environment when running install scripts.\nSince 0.60.0 DESTDIR and --destdir can be a path relative to build\ndirectory. An absolute path will be set into environment when executing scripts.\n"});
