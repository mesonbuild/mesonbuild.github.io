You can use\nspare hardware, VirtualBox, cloud or whatever you want. Note that the\ndistro you install must be at least as old as the oldest release you\nwish to support. Debian stable is usually a good choice, though\nimmediately after its release you might want to use Debian oldstable\nor the previous Ubuntu LTS. The oldest supported version of CentOS is\nalso a good choice.\nOnce you have installed the system, you need to install\nbuild-dependencies for GCC. In Debian-based distros this can be done\nwith the following commands:\nThen create a src subdirectory in your home directory. Copy-paste\nthe following into install_gcc.sh and execute it.\nThen finally add the following lines to your .bashrc.\nLog out and back in and now your build environment is ready to use.\n"});
