fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Unit-tests.html#parallelism","fragment":"Parallelism\nTo reduce test times, Meson will by default run multiple unit tests in\nparallel. It is common to have some tests which cannot be run in\nparallel because they require unique hold on some resource such as a\nfile or a D-Bus name. You have to specify these tests with a keyword\nargument.\nMeson will then make sure that no other unit test is running at the\nsame time. Non-parallel tests take longer to run so it is recommended\nthat you write your unit tests to be parallel executable whenever\npossible.\nBy default Meson uses as many concurrent processes as there are cores\non the test machine. You can override this with the environment\nvariable MESON_TESTTHREADS like this.\nSetting MESON_TESTTHREADS to 0 enables the default behavior (core\ncount), whereas setting an invalid value results in setting the job\ncount to 1.\n"});
