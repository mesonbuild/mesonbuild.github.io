This is awkward on many platforms, especially\non ones that do not have a built-in package manager. The latter problem\nhas been worked around by having third party package managers. They\nare not really a solution for end user deployment, because you can't\ntell them to install a package manager just to use your app. On these\nplatforms you must produce self-contained applications. Same applies\nwhen destination platform is missing (up-to-date versions of) your\napplication's dependencies.\nThe traditional approach to this has been to bundle dependencies\ninside your own project. Either as prebuilt libraries and headers or\nby embedding the source code inside your source tree and rewriting\nyour build system to build them as part of your project.\nThis is both tedious and error prone because it is always done by\nhand. The Wrap dependency system of Meson aims to provide an automated\nway to do this.\n"});
