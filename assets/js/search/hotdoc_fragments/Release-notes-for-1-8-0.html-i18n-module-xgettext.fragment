It allows to extract strings to translate from\nsource files.\nThis function is convenient, because:\n\nIt can find the sources files from a build target;\nIt will use an intermediate file when the number of source files is too\nbig to be handled directly from the command line;\nIt is able to get strings to translate from the dependencies of the given\ntargets.\n\n"});
