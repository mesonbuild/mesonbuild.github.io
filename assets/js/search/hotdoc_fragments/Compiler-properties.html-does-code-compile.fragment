fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Compiler-properties.html#does-code-compile","fragment":"Does code compile?\nSometimes the only way to test the system is to try to compile some\nsample code and see if it works. For example, this can test that a\n\"C++17\" compiler actually supports a particular C++17 feature,\nwithout resorting to maintaining a feature list vs. compiler vendor,\ncompiler version and operating system.\nTesting that a code snippet runs is a two-phase operation. First\nwe define some code using the multiline string operator:\nThen we can run the test.\nThe variable result will now contain either true or false\ndepending on whether the compilation succeeded or not. The keyword\nargument name is optional. If it is specified, Meson will write the\nresult of the check to its log.\n"});
