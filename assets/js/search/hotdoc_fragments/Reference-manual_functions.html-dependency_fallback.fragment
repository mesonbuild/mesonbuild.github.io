fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#dependency_fallback","fragment":"Manually specifies a subproject fallback\nto use in case the dependency is not found in the system.\nThis is useful if the automatic search is not applicable or if you\nwant to support versions of Meson older than 0.55.0.  If the value is an\narray ['subproj_name', 'subproj_dep'], the first value is the name\nof the subproject and the second is the variable name in that\nsubproject that contains a dependency object such as the return\nvalue of declare_dependency() or\ndependency(), etc. Note that this means the\nfallback dependency may be a not-found dependency, in which\ncase the value of the required: kwarg will be obeyed.\nSince 0.54.0 the value can be a single string, the subproject name;\nin this case the subproject must use\nmeson.override_dependency('dependency_name', subproj_dep)\nto specify the dependency object used in the superproject.\nIf the value is an empty array it has the same effect as\nallow_fallback: false.\n"});
