To enable this feature, set the target kwarg\nswift_interoperability_mode to 'cpp'.\nTo import C++ code, specify a bridging header in the Swift target's\nsources, or use another way such as adding a directory containing a\nClang module map to its include path.\nNote: Enabling C++ interoperability in a library target is a breaking\nchange. Swift libraries that enable it need their consumers to enable\nit as well, as per the Swift documentation.\nSwift 5.9 is required to use this feature. Xcode 15 is required if the\nXcode backend is used.\n"});
