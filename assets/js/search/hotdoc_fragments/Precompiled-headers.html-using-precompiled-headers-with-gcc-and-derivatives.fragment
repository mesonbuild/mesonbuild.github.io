As an example, let's\nassume you want to build a small C binary with precompiled headers.\nLet's say the source files of the binary use the system headers\nstdio.h and string.h. Then you create a header file\npch/myexe_pch.h with this content:\nAnd add this to Meson:\nThat's all. You should note that your source files must not include\nthe file myexe_pch.h and you must not add the pch subdirectory to\nyour search path. Any modification of the original program files is\nnot necessary. Meson will make the compiler include the pch with\ncompiler options. If you want to disable pch (because of, say,\ncompiler bugs), it can be done entirely on the build system side with\nno changes to source code.\nYou can use precompiled headers on any build target. If your target\nhas multiple languages, you can specify multiple pch files like this.\n"});
