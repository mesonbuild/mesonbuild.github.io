Now you also can use meson.py introspect --projectinfo project-dir/meson.build.\nThe output is similar to the output with a build directory but\nadditionally also includes information from introspect --buildsystem-files.\nFor example meson.py introspect --projectinfo test\\ cases/common/47\\ subproject\\ options/meson.build This outputs (pretty printed for\nreadability):\nBoth usages now include a new descriptive_name property which always\nshows the name set in the project.\n"});
