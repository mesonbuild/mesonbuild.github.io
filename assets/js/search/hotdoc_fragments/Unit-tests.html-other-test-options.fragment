Just doing this:\nMeson will launch gdb all set up to run the test. Just type run in\nthe GDB command prompt to start the program.\nThe second use case is a test that segfaults only rarely. In this case\nyou can invoke the following command:\nThis runs the test up to 10 000 times under GDB automatically. If the\nprogram crashes, GDB will halt and the user can debug the application.\nNote that testing timeouts are disabled in this case so meson test\nwill not kill gdb while the developer is still debugging it. The\ndownside is that if the test binary freezes, the test runner will wait\nforever.\nSometimes, the GDB binary is not in the PATH variable or the user\nwants to use a GDB replacement. Therefore, the invoked GDB program can\nbe specified (added 0.52.0):\nMeson will report the output produced by the failing tests along with\nother useful information as the environmental variables. This is\nuseful, for example, when you run the tests on Travis-CI, Jenkins and\nthe like.\nFor further information see the command line help of Meson by running\nmeson test -h.\n"});
