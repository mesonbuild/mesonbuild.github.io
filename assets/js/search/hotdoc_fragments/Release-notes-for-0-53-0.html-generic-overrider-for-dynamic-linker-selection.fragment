Unfortunately this broke\nchoosing a non-default linker.\nNow there is a generic mechanism for doing this. In 0.53.0, you can\nuse the LD environment variable. In 0.53.1 this was changed to\n<compiler_variable>_LD, such as CC_LD, CXX_LD, D_LD, etc due\nto regressions. The usual Meson environment variable\nrules\napply. Alternatively, you can add the following to a cross or native\nfile:\nIn 0.53.0:\nIn 0.53.1 or newer:\nAnd Meson will select the linker if possible.\n"});
