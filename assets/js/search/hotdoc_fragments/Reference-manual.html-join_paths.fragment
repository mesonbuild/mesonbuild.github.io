fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual.html#join_paths","fragment":"join_paths()\n(since 0.36.0)\nJoins the given strings into a file system path segment. For example\njoin_paths('foo', 'bar') results in foo/bar. If any one of the\nindividual segments is an absolute path, all segments before it are\ndropped. That means that join_paths('foo', '/bar') returns /bar.\nWarning Don't use join_paths() for sources in library and\nexecutable, you should use files instead.\n(since 0.49.0) Using the/ operator on strings is equivalent to calling\njoin_paths.\n"});
