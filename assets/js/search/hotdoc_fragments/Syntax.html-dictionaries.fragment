Keys are required to be\nstrings, but values can be objects of any type. Prior to 0.53.0 keys\nwere required to be literal strings, i.e., you could not use a\nvariable containing a string value as a key.\nKeys must be unique:\nDictionaries are immutable and do not have a guaranteed order.\nDictionaries are available since 0.47.0.\nVisit the dict objects page in the Reference Manual to read\nabout the methods exposed by dictionaries.\nSince 0.49.0, you can check if a dictionary contains a key like this:\nSince 0.53.0 Keys can be any expression evaluating to a string\nvalue, not limited to string literals any more.\n"});
