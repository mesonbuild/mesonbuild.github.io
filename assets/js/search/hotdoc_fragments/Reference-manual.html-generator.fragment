fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "generator \nSee also custom_target \nThis function creates a generator object that can be used to run custom compilation commands. The only positional argument is the executable to use. It can either be a self built executable or one returned by find_program. Keyword arguments are the following \nThe returned object also has methods that are documented in the object methods section below. \nThe template strings passed to all the above keyword arguments accept the following special substitutions \nEach string passed to the outputs keyword argument must be constructed using one or both of these two substitutions. \nIn addition to the above substitutions the arguments keyword argument also accepts the following \nNOTE Generators should only be used for outputs that will only be used as inputs for a build target or a custom target. When you use the processed output of a generator in multiple targets the generator will be run multiple times to create outputs for each target. Each output will be created in a target private directory BUILD_DIR \nIf you want to generate files for general purposes such as for generating headers to be used by several sources or data that will be installed and so on use a custom_target instead. \n", "url": "Reference-manual.html#generator"});
