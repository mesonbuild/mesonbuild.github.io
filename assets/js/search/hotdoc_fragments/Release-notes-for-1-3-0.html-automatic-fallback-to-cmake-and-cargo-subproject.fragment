However until now it was not possible to use a CMake subproject\nas fallback in a dependency() call.\nA wrap file can now specify the method used to build it by setting the method\nkey in the wrap file's first section. The method defaults to meson.\nSupported methods:\n\n\nmeson requires meson.build file.\n\ncmake requires CMakeLists.txt file. See details.\n\ncargo requires Cargo.toml file. See details.\n\n"});
