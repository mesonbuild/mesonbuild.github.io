Even with this extremely simple\nexample we can find differences between various popular build systems.\nAs the project size increases, these differences grow even larger.\n(The author has witnessed no-op build times of 30 seconds for Make\nversus less than one second for Ninja when compiling the Clang\ncompiler.) Keeping incremental build times low is one of the major\nkeys of programmer productivity as it allows developers to iterate\nfaster and stay in the creative zone.\n"});
