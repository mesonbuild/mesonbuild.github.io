There is also a plain type that\nadds nothing by default but instead makes it the user's responsibility\nto add everything by hand. This works but is a bit tedious.\nIn this release we have added new new options to manually toggle e.g.\noptimization levels and debug info so those can be changed\nindependently of other options. For example by default the debug\nbuildtype has no optmization enabled at all. If you wish to use GCC's\n-Og instead, you could set it with the following command:\nSimilarly we have added a toggle option to select the version of\nVisual Studio C runtime to use. By default it uses the debug runtime\nDLL debug builds and release DLL for release builds but this can be\nmanually changed with the new base option b_vscrt.\n"});
