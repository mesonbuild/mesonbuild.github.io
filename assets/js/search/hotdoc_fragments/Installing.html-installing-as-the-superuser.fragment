fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Installing.html#installing-as-the-superuser","fragment":"Installing as the superuser\nWhen building as a non-root user, but installing to root-owned locations via\ne.g. sudo ninja install, ninja will attempt to rebuild any out of date\ntargets as root. This results in various bad behaviors due to build outputs and\nninja internal files being owned by root.\nRunning meson install is preferred for several reasons. It can rebuild out of\ndate targets and then re-invoke itself as root. (since 1.1.0) Additionally,\nrunning sudo meson install will drop permissions and rebuild out of date\ntargets as the original user, not as root.\n(since 1.1.0) Re-invoking as root will try to guess the user's preferred method for\nre-running commands as root. The order of precedence is: sudo, doas, run0, pkexec\n(polkit). An elevation tool can be forced by setting $MESON_ROOT_CMD.\n"});
