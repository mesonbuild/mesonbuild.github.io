Thus you need to specify include directories. Let's assume\nthat we are at some subdirectory and wish to add its include\nsubdirectory to some target's search path. To create a include\ndirectory object we do this:\nThe incdir variable now holds a reference to the include subdir.\nNow we pass that as an argument to a build target:\nNote that these two commands can be given in any subdirectories and it\nwill still work. Meson will keep track of the locations and generate\nproper compiler flags to make it all work.\nAnother thing to note is that include_directories adds both the\nsource directory and corresponding build directory to include path, so\nyou don't have to care.\n"});
