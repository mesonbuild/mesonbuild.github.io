fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions.html#run_target","fragment":"run_target()\nThis function creates a new top-level target that runs a specified\ncommand with the specified arguments. Like all top-level targets, this\nintegrates with the selected backend. For instance, you can run it as\nmeson compile target_name. Note that a run target produces no output\nas far as Meson is concerned. It is only meant for tasks such as\nrunning a code formatter or flashing an external device's firmware\nwith a built file.\nThe command is run from an unspecified directory, and Meson will set\nthree environment variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT, MESON_BUILD_ROOT\nand MESON_SUBDIR that specify the source directory, build directory\nand subdirectory the target was defined in, respectively.\nSince 0.57.0 The template strings passed to command keyword arguments accept\nthe following special substitutions:\n\n\n\n\n@SOURCE_ROOT@: the path to the root of the source tree. Depending on the backend,\nthis may be an absolute or a relative to current workdir path.\n\n@BUILD_ROOT@: the path to the root of the build tree. Depending on the backend,\nthis may be an absolute or a relative to current workdir path.\n\n@CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@ Since 0.57.1: this is the directory where the currently\nprocessed meson.build is located in. Depending on the backend,\nthis may be an absolute or a relative to current workdir path.\n\n"});
