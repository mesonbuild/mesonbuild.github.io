The linked sample code does it by\nhaving two different scripts. This separates the different pieces\ngenerating the installer into logical pieces.\ninstall_script.sh only deals with embedding dependencies and fixing\nthe library paths.\nbuild_osx_installer.sh sets up the build with the proper paths,\ncompiles, installs and generates the .dmg package.\nThe main reasoning here is that in order to build a complete OSX\ninstaller package from source, all you need to do is to cd into the\nsource tree and run ./build_osx_installer.sh. To build packages on\nother platforms you would write scripts such as\nbuild_windows_installer.bat and so on.\n"});
