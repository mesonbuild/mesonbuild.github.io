fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Putting it all together \nThere are many ways to put the dmg installer together and different people will do it in different ways. The linked sample code does it by having two different scripts. This separates the different pieces generating the installer into logical pieces. \ninstall_script.sh only deals with embedding dependencies and fixing the library paths. \nbuild_osx_installer.sh sets up the build with the proper paths compiles installs and generates the dmg package. \nThe main reasoning here is that in order to build a complete OSX installer package from source all you need to do is to cd into the source tree and run build_osx_installer.sh. To build packages on other platforms you would write scripts such as build_windows_installer.bat and so on. \n", "url": "Creating-OSX-packages.html#putting-it-all-together"});
