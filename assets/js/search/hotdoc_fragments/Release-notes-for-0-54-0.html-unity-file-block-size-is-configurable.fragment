This is the most\nefficient setting for full builds but makes incremental builds slow.\nThis release adds a new option unity_size which specifies how many\nsource files should be put in each unity file.\nThe default value for block size is 4. This means that if you have a\ntarget that has eight source files, Meson will generate two unity\nfiles each of which includes four source files. The old behaviour can\nbe replicated by setting unity_size to a large value, such as 10000.\n"});
