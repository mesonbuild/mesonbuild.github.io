fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual_functions_executable.html#executable_build_subdir","fragment":"Places the build results in a subdirectory of the given name rather than directly into the build directory. This does not affect the install directory, which uses install_dir.\nThis allows inserting a directory name into the build path, either when needed to use the build result while building other targets or as a way to support multiple targets with the same basename by using unique build_subdir values for each one.\nTo prevent collisions within the build directory, build_subdir is not allowed to match a file or directory in the source directory, nor contain '..' to refer to the parent of the build directory.\n(since 1.10.0)\n"});
