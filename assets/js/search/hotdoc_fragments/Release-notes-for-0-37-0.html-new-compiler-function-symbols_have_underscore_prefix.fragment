This is useful when linking to\ncompiled assembly code, or other code that does not have its C symbol\nmangling handled transparently by the compiler.\nC symbol mangling is platform and architecture dependent, and a helper\nfunction is needed to detect it. For example, Windows 32-bit prefixes\nunderscore, but 64-bit does not. Linux does not prefix an underscore\nbut OS X does.\n"});
