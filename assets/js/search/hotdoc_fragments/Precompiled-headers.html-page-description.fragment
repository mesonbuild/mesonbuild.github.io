You can also toggle the use of pch in a configured build directory with the GUI tool. You don t have to do any changes to the source code. Typically this is done to test whether your project compiles cleanly without pch that is checking that its includes are in order and working around compiler bugs. \nOnce you have a file to precompile you can enable the use of pch for a give target with a pch keyword argument. As an example here s how you would use it with a C binary. \nYou should note that your source files must not include the file myexe_pch.h and you must not add the pch subdirectory to your search path. Meson will make the compiler include the pch with compiler options. If you want to disable pch because of say compiler bugs it can be done entirely on the build system side with no changes to source code. \nYou can use precompiled headers on any build target. If your target has multiple languages you can specify multiple pch files like this. \nMSVC is a bit trickier because in addition to the header file it also requires a corresponding source file. If your header is called foo_pch.h the corresponding source file is usually called foo_pch.cpp and it resides in the same pch subdirectory as the header. Its contents are this \nTo enable pch simply list both files in the target definition \nThis form will work with both GCC and msvc because Meson knows that GCC does not need a cpp file and thus just ignores it. \nIt should be noted that due to implementation details of the MSVC compiler having precompiled headers for multiple languages in the same target is not guaranteed to work. \n"});
