All\narguments after the script name will be passed to the script.\nThe MESON_INSTALL_DESTDIR_PREFIX environment variable is now set\nwhen install scripts are called. This contains the values of the\nDESTDIR environment variable and the prefix option passed to Meson\njoined together. This is useful because both those are usually\nabsolute paths, and joining absolute paths in a cross-platform way is\ntricky. os.path.join in\nPython\nwill discard all previous path segments when it encounters an absolute\npath, and simply concatenating them will not work on Windows where\nabsolute paths begin with the drive letter.\n"});
