This can be done at\nany time after project has been called\nThere are several problems with the above approach:\nfs.read replaces the above idiom thus:\nThey are not equivalent, though. Files read with fs.read create a\nconfiguration dependency on the file, and so if the COPYING file is modified,\nMeson will automatically reconfigure, guaranteeing the build is consistent. It\ncan be used for any properly encoded text files. It supports specification of\nnon utf-8 encodings too, so if you're stuck with text files in a different\nencoding, it can be passed as an argument. See the meson\nobject documentation for details.\n"});
