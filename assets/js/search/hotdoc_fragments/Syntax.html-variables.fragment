fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Syntax.html#variables","fragment":"Variables\nVariables in Meson work just like in other high level programming\nlanguages. A variable can contain a value of any type, such as an\ninteger or a string. Variables don't need to be predeclared, you can\njust assign to them and they appear. Here's how you would assign\nvalues to two different variables.\nOne important difference in how variables work in Meson is that all\nobjects are immutable. When you see an operation which appears like\na mutation, actually a new object is created and assigned to the\nname. This is different from, for example, how Python works for\nobjects, but similar to e.g. Python strings.\n"});
