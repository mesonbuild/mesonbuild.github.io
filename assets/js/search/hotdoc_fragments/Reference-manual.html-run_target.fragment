fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Reference-manual.html#run_target","fragment":"run_target\nThis function creates a new top-level target that runs a specified\ncommand with the specified arguments. Like all top-level targets, this\nintegrates with the selected backend. For instance, you can run it as\nmeson compile target_name. Note that a run target produces no output\nas far as Meson is concerned. It is only meant for tasks such as\nrunning a code formatter or flashing an external device's firmware\nwith a built file.\nThe command is run from an unspecified directory, and Meson will set\nthree environment variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT, MESON_BUILD_ROOT\nand MESON_SUBDIR that specify the source directory, build directory\nand subdirectory the target was defined in, respectively.\nSince 0.57.0 The template strings passed to command keyword arguments accept\nthe following special substitutions:\n\n\ncommand is a list containing the command to run and the arguments\nto pass to it. Each list item may be a string or a target. For\ninstance, passing the return value of executable()\nas the first item will run that executable, or passing a string as\nthe first item will find that command in PATH and run it.\n\ndepends is a list of targets that this target depends on but which\nare not listed in the command array (because, for example, the\nscript does file globbing internally)\n\nenv (since 0.57.0): environment variables to set, such as\n{'NAME1': 'value1', 'NAME2': 'value2'} or ['NAME1=value1', 'NAME2=value2'],\nor an environment() object which allows more\nsophisticated environment juggling.\n\n\n\n@SOURCE_ROOT@: the path to the root of the source tree. Depending on the backend,\nthis may be an absolute or a relative to current workdir path.\n\n@BUILD_ROOT@: the path to the root of the build tree. Depending on the backend,\nthis may be an absolute or a relative to current workdir path.\n\n@CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@ Since 0.57.1: this is the directory where the currently\nprocessed meson.build is located in. Depending on the backend,\nthis may be an absolute or a relative to current workdir path.\n\n"});
