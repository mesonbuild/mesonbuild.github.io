fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"CMake-module.html#cross-compilation","fragment":"Cross compilation\nNew in 0.56.0\nMeson will try to automatically guess most of the required CMake\ntoolchain variables from existing entries in the cross and native\nfiles. These variables will be stored in an automatically generate\nCMake toolchain file in the build directory. The remaining variables\nthat can't be guessed can be added by the user in the [cmake]\ncross/native file section (new in 0.56.0).\nAdding a manual CMake toolchain file is also supported with the\ncmake_toolchain_file setting in the [properties] section. Directly\nsetting a CMake toolchain file with\n-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/some/Toolchain.cmake in the\nmeson.build is not supported since the automatically generated\ntoolchain file is also used by Meson to inject arbitrary code into\nCMake to enable the CMake subproject support.\nThe closest configuration to only using a manual CMake toolchain file\nwould be to set these options in the machine file:\nThis will result in a toolchain file with just the bare minimum to\nenable the CMake subproject support and include() the\ncmake_toolchain_file as the last instruction.\nFor more information see the cross and native file\nspecification.\n"});
