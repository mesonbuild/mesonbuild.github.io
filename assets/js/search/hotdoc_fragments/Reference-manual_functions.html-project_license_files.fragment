Usually this would be\nsomething like license_files: ['COPYING'].\nNote that the files are informal and are only installed with the dependency\nmanifest. Meson does not do any license validation, you are responsible\nfor verifying that you abide by all licensing terms. You can access the\nvalue in your Meson build files with meson.project_license_files().\n(since 1.1.0)\n"});
