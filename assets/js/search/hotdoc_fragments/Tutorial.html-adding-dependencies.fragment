Let's update our program to\ncreate a graphical window instead. We'll use the\nGTK+ widget toolkit. First we edit the main file to\nuse GTK+. The new version looks like this.\nThen we edit the Meson file, instructing it to find and use the GTK+\nlibraries.\nIf your app needs to use multiple libraries, you need to use separate\ndependency() calls for each, like so:\nWe don't need it for the current example.\nNow we are ready to build. The thing to notice is that we do not\nneed to recreate our build directory, run any sort of magical commands\nor the like. Instead we just type the exact same command as if we were\nrebuilding our code without any build system changes.\nOnce you have set up your build directory the first time, you don't\never need to run the meson command again. You always just run meson compile. Meson will automatically detect when you have done changes\nto build definitions and will take care of everything so users don't\nhave to care. In this case the following output is produced.\nNote how Meson noticed that the build definition has changed and reran\nitself automatically. The program is now ready to be run:\nThis creates the following GUI application.\n\n"});
