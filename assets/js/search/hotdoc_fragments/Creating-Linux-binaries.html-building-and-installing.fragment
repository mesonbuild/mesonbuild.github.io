There are just two\nthings to note. First, you must tell GCC to link the C++ standard\nlibrary statically. If you don't then your app is guaranteed to break\nas different distros have binary-incompatible C++ libraries. The\nsecond thing is that you need to point your install prefix to some\nempty staging area. Here's the Meson command to do that:\nThe aim is to put the executable in /tmp/myapp/bin and shared\nlibraries to /tmp/myapp/lib. The next thing you need is the\nembedder. It takes your dependencies (in this case only\nlibSDL2-2.0.so.0) and copies them in the lib directory. Depending on\nyour use case you can either copy the files by hand or write a script\nthat parses the output of ldd binary_file. Be sure not to copy\nsystem libraries (libc, libpthread, libm etc). For an example,\nsee the sample\nproject.\nMake the script run during install with this:\n"});
