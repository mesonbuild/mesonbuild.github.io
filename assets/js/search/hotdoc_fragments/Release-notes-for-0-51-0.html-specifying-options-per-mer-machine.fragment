Now, prefix the\noption with build. to affect build machine targets, and leave it\nunprefixed to affect host machine targets.\nFor those trying to ensure native and cross builds to the same\nplatform produced the same result, the old way was frustrating because\nvery different invocations were needed to affect the same targets, if\nit was possible at all. Now, the same command line arguments affect\nthe same targets everywhere --- Meson is closer to ignoring whether\nthe \"overall\" build is native or cross, and just caring about whether\nindividual targets are for the build or host machines.\n"});
