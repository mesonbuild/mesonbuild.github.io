If a list of languages is given the arguments are added to each of the corresponding compiler command lines. Note that there is no way to remove an argument set in this way. If you have an argument that is only used in a subset of targets you have to specify it in per target flags. \nThe arguments are used in all compiler invocations with the exception of compile tests because you might need to run a compile test with and without the argument in question. For this reason only the arguments explicitly specified are used during compile tests. \nNote Usually you should use add_project_arguments instead because that works even when you project is used as a subproject. \nNote You must pass always arguments individually arg1 arg2 rather than as a string arg1 arg2 \n"});
