The\nkeyword argument extra_args, if specified, will be used to replace\nan entry @EXTRA_ARGS@ in the argument list. The keyword argument\npreserve_path_from, if given, specifies that the output files need\nto maintain their directory structure inside the target temporary\ndirectory. The most common value for this is\nmeson.current_source_dir(). With this value when a file called\nsubdir/one.input is processed it generates a file <target private directory>/subdir/one.out as opposed to <target private directory>/one.out.\n\n"});
