To start the build simply type the following command. \nThe main usability difference between Ninja and Make is that Ninja will automatically detect the number of CPUs in your computer and parallelize itself accordingly. You can override the amount of parallel processes used with the command line argument j num processes \nIt should be noted that after the initial configure step ninja is the only command you ever need to type to compile. No matter how you alter your source tree short of moving it to a completely new location Meson will detect the changes and regenerate itself accordingly. This is especially handy if you have multiple build directories. Often one of them is used for development the debug build and others only every now and then such as a static analysis build Any configuration can be built just by cd ing to the corresponding directory and running Ninja. \n"});
