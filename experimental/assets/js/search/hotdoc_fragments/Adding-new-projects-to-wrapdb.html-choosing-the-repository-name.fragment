fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Choosing the repository name \nWrapped subprojects are used much like external dependencies. Thus they should have the same name as the upstream projects. If the project provides a pkg config file then the repository name should be the same as the pkg config name. Usually this is the name of the project such as libpng. Sometimes it is slightly different however. As an example the libogg project s chosen pkg config name is ogg instead of libogg which is the reason why the repository is named plain ogg. \n", "url": "Adding-new-projects-to-wrapdb.html#choosing-the-repository-name"});
