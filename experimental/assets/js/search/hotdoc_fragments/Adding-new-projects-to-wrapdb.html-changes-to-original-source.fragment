fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Changes to original source \nThe point of a wrap is to provide the upstream project with as few changes as possible. Most projects should not contain anything more than a few Meson definition files. Sometimes it may be necessary to add a template header file or something similar. These should be held at a minimum. \nIt should especially be noted that there must not be any patches to functionality. All such changes must be submitted to upstream. You may also host your own Git repo with the changes if you wish. The Wrap system has native support for Git subprojects. \n", "url": "Adding-new-projects-to-wrapdb.html#changes-to-original-source"});
