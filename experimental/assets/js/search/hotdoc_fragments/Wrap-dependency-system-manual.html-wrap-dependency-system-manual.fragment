This is easy on Linux where you can use system packages but awkward on other platforms. Most of those do not have a package manager at all. This has been worked around by having third party package managers. They are not really a solution for end user deployment because you can t tell them to install a package manager just to use your app. On these platforms you must produce self contained applications. \nThe traditional approach to this has been to bundle dependencies inside your own project. Either as prebuilt libraries and headers or by embedding the source code inside your source tree and rewriting your build system to build them as part of your project. \nThis is both tedious and error prone because it is always done by hand.
