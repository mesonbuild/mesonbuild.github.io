fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Generating-sources.html#generating-sources", "fragment": "Generating sources \nSometimes source files need to be preprocessed before they are passed to the actual compiler. As an example you might want build an IDL compiler and then run some files through that to generate actual source files. In Meson this is done with the following lines of code. \nFirst we build the executable. \nThen we define a generator which defines how to transform input files into output files. \nThe first argument is the executable file to run. The next file specifies a name generation rule. It specifies how to build the output file name for a given input name. BASENAME is a placeholder for the input file name without preceding path or suffix if any So if the input file name were some path filename.idl then the output name would be filename.c. You can also use PLAINNAME which preserves the suffix which would result in a file called filename.idl.c. The last line specifies the command line arguments to pass to the executable. INPUT and OUTPUT are placeholders for the input and output files respectively and will be automatically filled in by Meson. If your rule produces multiple output files and you need to pass them to the command line append the location to the output holder like this OUTPUT0 OUTPUT1 and so on. \nWith this rule specified we can generate source files and add them to a target. \nGenerators can generate more than one output file. \nIn this case you can not use the plain OUTPUT variable as it would be ambiguous. This program only needs to know the output directory it will generate the file names by itself. \n"});
