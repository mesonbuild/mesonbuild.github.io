Here is a list of items to check in the review. If some item is not met it does not mean that the package is rejected. What should be done will be determined on a case by case basis. Similarly meeting all these requirements does not guarantee that the package will get accepted. Use common sense. \n", "url": "Wrap-review-guidelines.html#wrap-review-guidelines"});
